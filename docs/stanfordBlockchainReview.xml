<div> 关键词：zkSharding、sharded区块链架构、跨链通信、费用模型、链结构

总结:

这篇文章旨在构建一个评估框架来比较不同的分片区块链架构，特别是zkSharding。首先定义了分片区块链为一种机制，通过将计算能力和状态进行分割，允许区块链内部并行执行交易。文章进一步探讨了分片创建的不同方式，如受权限的和无权限的创建，以及不同架构下的费用模型（本地市场和全球市场）。

对于链结构，文章指出所有分片系统都可以表示为有向无环图（DAG），但这种结构的严格程度可以从单一来源到强制更新不等。此外，文章还讨论了跨链结构对架构的影响，以及如何通过非交叠地址空间或共享全范围地址值来分区地址空间。

在跨链通信部分，文章区分了原子性和非原子性交易，以及验证机制的乐观验证和全验证方法。同时，文章强调了分片创建的权限控制和跨链消息的无权限发送，以及分片系统中地址空间的非交叠与全交叠。

最后，文章以zkSharding为例，展示了其如何结合上述特性实现应用扩展、市场驱动的负载平衡和信任无碍的并行计算。zkSharding采用受权限的分片创建、本地费用模型和强制更新的链结构，支持原子性较低的跨链交易，通过有向无环图连接分片，实现动态资源分配和智能合约间的高效交互。 <div>

In the course of our research, we wanted to find and define parallels between zkSharding and similar systems. This article addresses this question by explaining the key features of zkSharding through a taxonomy of sharded blockchain architectures.</p><p>While zkSharding is zkRollup, its rollup-specific features are out of the scope of this article.</p><h3><strong>Sharded Blockchain Architectures</strong></h3><p>In this article, we&#8217;re generalizing sharding to include blockchain architectures that enable scaling through partitioning of state and execution.</p><p>Within this broad scope, we can examine multi-chain architectures like Polkadot or Cosmos; unified sharded systems like zkSharding or NEAR; and even Ethereum&#8217;s rollup-centric roadmap.</p><p>While these systems vary in architecture and in particular designations around sovereignty and interoperability, they share the same goal of enabling parallel processing to improve the overall scalability of the network, similar to traditional sharding architectures.</p><h3><strong>Why We Need a Standardized Evaluation Framework</strong></h3><p>Although they share a similar goal and there are parallels in their approaches, comparing these architectures is far from straightforward. Each system comes with its own set of trade-offs, whether in terms of decentralization, security, or consensus mechanisms. Without a structured framework for evaluation, achieving a uniform assessment is nearly impossible.</p><p>On one hand, a robust evaluation framework would help developers come to the best choice when deciding on a blockchain for their applications.</p><p>On the other, such a framework would help protocols developers identify and apply the best market practices and understand which features their customers actually need.</p><p>To address this, we propose a clear taxonomy to help categorize and compare sharded blockchain architectures. In this article, we aim to define such a taxonomy, using zkSharding as a case study.</p><p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> <em>While multi-chain systems emphasize creating interconnected ecosystems, it&#8217;s important to recognize the role of interoperability&#8212;the mechanism that enables data transfer between chains. In this article, we do not consider interoperability solutions separately from the whole system that they create.</em></p><h2><strong>Defining Blockchain Sharding</strong></h2><p>Sharding in blockchain still lacks a universally agreed-upon definition. However, for the purposes of this article, we define <em>blockchain sharding</em> as a mechanism that partitions computational power and state to allow parallel execution of transactions within a blockchain architecture. It splits the original system into shards, where each shard is responsible for processing only a portion of the transactions.</p><p>As mentioned above, this broad definition allows us to consider multi-chain systems systems that implement blockchain sharding. For the sake of consistency, we will refer to them as <em>sharded systems</em> throughout this article, with their individual chains functioning as <em>shards</em>.</p><p>In some cases, blockchain sharding is classified in the following way [2][3]:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Network sharding</strong> &#8211; dividing the network&#8217;s nodes into smaller groups.</p></li><li><p><strong>Transaction sharding</strong> &#8211; splitting the transaction load across different shards.</p></li><li><p><strong>State sharding</strong> &#8211; partitioning the blockchain&#8217;s state (account balances, smart contract data) into separate shards.</p></li></ol><p>Additionally, sharding can be either <em>dynamic</em> or <em>static</em>. Dynamic sharding adjusts the number and configuration of shards based on network demands, while static sharding maintains a fixed number of shards.</p><p>We do not consider this classification as sufficient for comparing different architectures. For example, to the best of our knowledge, all existing network-sharded projects are also state-sharded. Moreover, state sharding does not explain anything about the underlying mechanisms: zkSharding, Polkadot, and zkSync Elastic Chains can all be classified as state-sharded, yet these projects are very different.</p><p>To properly evaluate and compare these systems, we need to extend beyond the traditional categories and consider other factors such as security models, consensus mechanisms, and inter-shard communication protocols.</p><h2><strong>Properties of Sharded Systems</strong></h2><p>The evaluation framework suggested below is based on key properties of sharded systems that define their behavior and efficiency.</p><h3><strong>Shard Creation</strong></h3><p>When it comes to shard creation, we categorize it into two main types:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Permissioned</strong>: In this model, a new shard can only be created with explicit permission, either from the protocol or through social consensus. NEAR is an example of such a system [4].</p></li><li><p><strong>Permissionless</strong>: Permissionless systems allow anyone to create a new shard at any time without needing approval. For example, zkSync allows anyone to create their own rollup.</p></li></ul><p>Shard creation has significant implications for the overall system, most significantly cross-shard messaging. <strong>Permissioned systems</strong> can adjust shard creation dynamically, scaling based on the network's current load. This ensures efficient resource allocation and allows for stricter control over security and interoperability.</p><p>In contrast, <strong>permissionless systems</strong> often result in new chains with their own technical stacks, enabling the creation of specialized shards optimized for specific tasks. However, this flexibility can introduce complexities, such as inconsistent UX and unpredictable security guarantees. For instance, shards with different execution environments, like EVM or WASM VMs, may enhance specialization but reduce interoperability, complicating cross-shard development. Even more, any difference in trust assumptions between shards influences cross-shard messaging mechanism capabilities.</p><h3><strong>Fee Model</strong></h3><p>In the context of sharded systems, the fee model defines how transaction fees are calculated across different chains or shards. We distinguish between two primary types:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Local Fee Market</strong>: In these systems, each chain or shard calculates its fees separately, either fully independently or with some base fee applied across the entire network (eg. Cosmos).</p></li><li><p><strong>Global Fee Market</strong>: In this model, the protocol defines a unified fee structure for all chains or shards, where fees are the same across the entire system (eg. NEAR or TON).</p></li></ul><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3e053d67-2ae4-4b3c-9127-c658da9eb883_1600x1060.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="965" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3e053d67-2ae4-4b3c-9127-c658da9eb883_1600x1060.png" width="1456" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>The <strong>global fee market</strong> model makes cross-shard transactions more predictable for users, as they don&#8217;t have to worry about varying fee structures across different chains. However, this simplicity comes at the cost of leaving all load-balancing to the dynamic sharding mechanisms, which increases the overall complexity of the system.</p><h3><strong>Inter-Chain Structure</strong></h3><p>The <strong>Chain Structure</strong> defines the rules for how blocks are connected between different shards. In essence, all sharded systems can be represented in some form of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). Though not always immediately obvious, whenever a transaction from one shard is included in another shard, the destination shard incorporates a fingerprint of the originating shard at a specific time, forming a DAG.</p><p>However, the strictness of this DAG structure can vary:</p><ul><li><p><strong>DAG with a Single Source</strong>: The most strict structure, where all shards not only maintain links between each other but also share a common ancestor, such as the genesis block. This creates a tightly coupled system with a unified starting point. Sharded systems like NEAR or TON follow this model.</p></li><li><p><strong>DAG with Enforced Updates</strong>: In this model, shards are independent chains but must periodically include information about other shards. For instance, this could involve embedding the block hashes of other shards into each new block. As we discuss in the next sections, zkSharding falls into this class.</p></li><li><p><strong>DAG without Enforced Updates</strong>: In this looser structure, shards only include information from other shards on-demand, typically when a cross-shard transaction occurs.</p></li></ul><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4d3d0ba8-3f1e-48a5-9d9b-6fe64f671352_1600x1060.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="965" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4d3d0ba8-3f1e-48a5-9d9b-6fe64f671352_1600x1060.png" width="1456" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>The inter-chain structure, alongside cross-shard messaging mechanisms, introduces an additional layer to the architecture: the <strong>topology of shards</strong>. Just as networks can have topologies with dedicated nodes to simplify communication, shareded systems may have specific shards designated for coordination. In most cases, these <strong>coordination shards</strong> exist to optimize communication between other shards, facilitating smoother cross-shard interactions.</p><p>Closely related to the <strong>inter-chain structure</strong> property is the concept of <strong>address space partitioning</strong>, which plays a crucial role in how accounts are distributed across shards. There are two main approaches to address space partitioning:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Non-Intersected Address Space</strong>: In this model, each address belongs to only one shard at any given time. This means that a particular address A can only exist on a specific shard, ensuring that accounts are uniquely assigned to individual shards.</p></li><li><p><strong>Full Address Space</strong>: In this model, all shards share the same full range of address values, meaning the same address can exist on multiple shards simultaneously. Interestingly, permissionless shard creation usually implies such an address space model (e.g. any interoperable rollup stack).</p></li></ul><h3><strong>Cross-shard Messaging</strong></h3><p>Cross-shard messaging mechanisms define how cross-shard transactions are executed within a sharded system. They govern several key processes, including:</p><ul><li><p>How the source shard creates a cross-shard transaction</p></li><li><p>How the destination shard validates incoming transaction validity</p></li><li><p>Whether cross-shard transactions have the same expressivity as intra-shard transactions or if they are limited in certain aspects</p></li><li><p>Whether cross-shard transactions are atomic or non-atomic</p></li><li><p>And many other considerations&#8230;</p></li></ul><p>Due to the complexity and variety of these mechanisms, it is challenging to establish a strict classification. However, we can outline some of the most important distinctions.</p><p><strong>By Atomic Property:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Atomic</strong>: A cross-shard transaction is either successful on both the source and destination shards, or it is reverted on both. This ensures that either all parts of the transaction succeed or none do, maintaining a consistent state across shards.</p></li><li><p><strong>Non-Atomic</strong>: In this model, a cross-shard transaction can succeed on one shard while failing or being reverted on another. This introduces potential inconsistency but can offer faster transaction processing. The inconsistency is usually solved via resolution process specific for each system.</p></li></ul><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83d28b64-8aa7-4f37-a3fd-462fb055fd06_1600x1600.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="1456" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83d28b64-8aa7-4f37-a3fd-462fb055fd06_1600x1600.png" width="1456" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>It is important to note that atomic mechanisms can be built on top of non-atomic transactions (see [here](https://docs.nil.foundation/nil/cookbook/swap/create-swap-contract/)).</p><p><strong>By Validation Mechanism:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Optimistic</strong>: In this approach, the destination shard applies cross-shard transactions optimistically, assuming they are valid if they are signed by the validators of the source shard. If an issue arises later, the transaction can be reverted. This mechanism provides faster execution but carries some risk of invalid transactions being processed initially.</p></li><li><p><strong>Full Verification</strong>: The destination shard applies cross-shard transactions only after fully validating their correctness from the source shard.</p></li></ul><p>While <strong>full verification mechanisms</strong> offer strong guarantees of correctness, they often result in reduced computational distribution (i.e., less effective sharding) or introduce delays in cross-shard communication, particularly when using advanced cryptographic tools like ZKPs.</p><p><strong>By Permission:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Permissioned</strong>: Even when the chain is technically compatible with others, sending cross-shard transactions may still require explicit approval, either from the protocol or the social layer. This is more common when <strong>chain creation</strong> is permissionless, as cross-shard messaging mechanisms are often permissioned to maintain security and control over cross-shard interactions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Permissionless</strong>: Once a chain or shard is created, it can freely send transactions to other shards without needing any further approval.</p></li></ul><h2><strong>Examining zkSharding Through the Proposed Evaluation Framework</strong></h2><p>To categorize zkSharding within the framework we've established, we must first introduce its core concepts. zkSharding partitions its state into the m<strong>ain shard</strong> and several <strong>execution shards</strong>. The main shard&#8217;s role is to synchronize and consolidate data from the execution shards. All validators validate the main shard.</p><p><strong>Execution shards</strong> act as workers, executing user transactions with an extended EVM. They communicate through a cross-shard messaging protocol, enabling the creation of cross-shard applications. Each execution shard is supervised by a committee of validators, and validator sets are periodically rotated across shards.</p><p>In addition, <strong>state transition proofs</strong> are generated for each shard periodically. These proofs are then aggregated and sent to the Ethereum network, which serves as the settlement layer. Each shard is finalized upon proof generation, ensuring secure state transitions.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c790056-8ca4-4816-a77c-5c6704abf690_1600x1600.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="1456" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c790056-8ca4-4816-a77c-5c6704abf690_1600x1600.png" width="1456" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><h3><strong>Chain Creation</strong></h3><p>From the <strong>chain creation</strong> perspective, zkSharding operates as a <strong>permissioned-by-protocol</strong> system: new shards are only created when existing execution shards become overloaded. Each new shard starts from an empty genesis block with no prior user data.</p><p>=nil;,'s first version of zkSharding will be <strong>permissioned-by-governance</strong>, where new shards are manually added via system updates. Over time, zkSharding is expected to transition from <strong>static</strong> to <strong>dynamic sharding</strong> while remaining permissioned in terms of chain creation.</p><h3><strong>Fee Model</strong></h3><p>zkSharding employs a <strong>local fee market model</strong>. While a shared base fee applies to all transactions, additional fees are determined via a first-bid model. The shared base fee covers:</p><ul><li><p><strong>L1 Proof Verification</strong>: The KZG commitment scheme ensures a fixed cost for proof verification, independent of shard load.</p></li><li><p><strong>Main Shard Maintenance</strong>: Though the main shard does not process user transactions, it plays a vital role in validator distribution and PoS mechanism control.</p></li></ul><h3><strong>Inter-Chain Structure</strong></h3><p>zkSharding follows a <strong>DAG with Enforced Updates</strong> structure, where execution shards and the main shard are connected through <strong>ShardDAG</strong> rules:</p><ul><li><p>Each block links to the previous block in its chain</p></li><li><p>Each block references a previous block in the main shard</p></li><li><p>Each block links to a set of blocks from other shards</p></li></ul><p>This structure ensures periodic updates across shards and maintains coordination. More details on ShardDAG can be found<a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/sharddag-ordering-and-exploitation-in-sharded-blockchains/20203"> here</a> [5].</p><p>Additionally, zkSharding follows non-intersected address space architecture.</p><h3><strong>Cross-shard Messaging Mechanisms</strong></h3><p><em>At the moment, we&#8217;re experimenting with two cross-shard communication protocols. They are very similar and differ only in how they handle errors. For clarity, we present the simpler mechanism below.</em></p><p>In zkSharding, cross-shard messaging between shards is achieved through cross-shard messaging protocols. Contracts can call precompiled contracts for cross-shard transactions, following these steps:</p><ol><li><p>A new transaction (<em>tx</em>) is created in the source shard&#8217;s block and added to an outgoing message queue.</p></li><li><p>Validators of the destination shard process the incoming message from the source shard&#8217;s header.</p></li><li><p>The transaction is added to the destination shard&#8217;s block and processed as usual.</p></li><li><p>If <em>tx</em> is reverted, a bounce message is sent back to the source shard, requiring the original contract to handle cross-shard errors.</p></li></ol><p>From the developer's perspective, this mechanism is implemented as a classic asynchronous programming paradigm, similar to communicating with smart contracts outside of the dApp chain. familiar from any communication with smart contracts outside of the chain.</p><p>From the <strong>cross-shard messaging</strong> perspective, zkSharding operates as:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Non-atomic</strong>: Transactions on the destination shard may be reverted, and smart contracts must handle these errors.</p></li><li><p><strong>Optimistic</strong>: Validators in the destination shard process transactions without waiting for zk-proof generation. In case of malicious validators on the source shard, rollbacks can occur. More details can be found in our<a href="https://nil.foundation/blog/post/security_zkSharding"> security blog post</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Permissionless</strong>: Any shard can send transactions to other shards without additional setup, ensuring free-flowing cross-shard communication.</p></li></ul><h3><strong>Combinations of the Properties</strong></h3><p>Let&#8217;s explore how specific combinations of zkSharding's properties enable a set of interesting features:</p><p><strong>Permissioned Chain Creation + Optimistic Non-Atomic Cross-shard Messaging</strong> <strong>= Application Scaling</strong></p><p>With <strong>Permissioned Chain Creation</strong>, zkSharding provides control over the execution environment of all shards, ensuring a <strong>unified execution environment</strong> across the network. This consistency allows developers to split their applications across shards and process transactions in parallel.</p><p>For example, a decentralized exchange (DEX) can distribute its liquidity pools across different shards. In this setup, high demand on one trading pair will not affect the performance of other pairs, even in the short term. To make this scalable architecture practical, <strong>optimistic, non-atomic cross-shard messaging</strong> ensures that cross-shard transactions are processed rapidly. While non-atomicity allows for potential reversion, it offers the speed needed for real-time application scaling. In this case, transactions can be processed as fast as two block times without delay for additional verification.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F26bd225a-22a4-4418-9ca2-2ed98d2a7a68_1600x766.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="697" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F26bd225a-22a4-4418-9ca2-2ed98d2a7a68_1600x766.png" width="1456" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>At the moment, we&#8217;re actively improving this design to make development experience of such applications even better.

In a non-intersecting account space model, users can &#8220;move&#8221; smart contracts from one shard to another. In a full address space, this could be achieved through mirroring the contract across multiple shards.</p><p>When each shard operates with its own gas pricing under a <strong>local fee model</strong>, a natural, market-driven load-balancing mechanism emerges. Application owners can choose to migrate their contracts to less congested shards based on the current gas prices. In theory, this migration can even be automated using on-chain triggers, dynamically optimizing for shard performance and gas costs.</p><p>This is part of our ongoing research and future work in zkSharding design.</p><p><strong>Optimistic Non-Atomic Cross-shard Messaging + DAG with Enforced Updates + ZKPs = Trustless Parallel Computation</strong></p><p>We&#8217;ve already discussed how <strong>optimistic, non-atomic cross-shard messaging </strong>facilitates efficient cross-shard applications. However, we must also address the computational power limitations of individual shards: for example, today we cannot run complex mathematical modeling on any EVM chain.</p><p>In zkSharding, we can add more shards without necessarily requiring more validators. If a shard is sufficiently decentralized, each validator can simply operate an additional machine for a new shard.</p><p><em>Note: There is a misleading belief that adding new shards means adding new validators. However, the whole point of sharding is to utilize parallel computational resources. This means that adding a new shard requires existing validators to run additional servers to maintain it. Adding new validators does not improve the security or scalability of the system.</em></p><p>The next step involves applying <strong>ZKPs</strong> (Zero-Knowledge Proofs). As ZKPs become faster, the economic incentive to attack an optimistic shard decreases, allowing for a smaller validator set and shorter optimistic windows. As ZKP technology advances, each shard becomes more computationally efficient. Note: a validator set still has to be decentralized to ensure censorship resistance.</p><p>This leads to a vision of a future with <strong>thousands of shards</strong>, each with a small validator set, processing data in parallel. This would function as a <strong>decentralized, trustless cloud computer</strong>, scaling blockchain computing to an entirely new level.</p><p>While this vision may still be a distant future, it is the future we are working toward with zkSharding.</p><h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>With the proposed framework, we're enabling builders to pick and choose properties they need in their sharded systems. For example, a fast high-throughput DEX that needs to interact with dApps on other chains might need a sharded system with non-atomic, optimistic and permissionless cross-shard messaging. Another application might need something else--the point of the framework is to decrease the time builders have to spend dealing with architecture complexity and enable faster development and ecosystem growth.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Thanks for reading the Stanford Blockchain Review!

<div> 关键词：知识产权、区块链、智能合约、法律系统、可编程产权

总结：

本文探讨了当前知识产权体系的困境及其如何通过区块链技术得到改善。首先，文章指出传统知识产权体系存在高门槛、碎片化、不透明和成本高昂的问题。接着，引入了“故事”（Story）项目作为解决方案，这是一个旨在将知识产权上链的平台，通过构建专为知识产权优化的基础层、智能合约协议以及法律框架，实现知识产权的可编程、主权和流动性。

基础层提供了一种专门针对知识产权设计的底层区块链网络，能够高效处理复杂的数据结构，如知识产权的树状关系，同时保持交易成本低。智能合约协议则使知识产权成为可编程的实体，能够执行许可、收益分配和争议解决等操作。法律框架即“可编程知识产权许可”（Programmable IP License），将现实世界中的法律体系与区块链上的数字资产相连接，确保链上操作具有法律效力。

通过这些技术手段，Story项目不仅使知识产权更加灵活和易管理，还为其提供了金融参与的可能性，推动了“知识产权金融”（IPFi）领域的发展。最终，区块链技术的应用有望改变知识产权的现有格局，使之成为互联网上的“知识产权乐园”。

文章强调了区块链技术在重塑知识产权体系方面的潜力，以及其对AI、去中心化金融（DeFi）和消费市场等领域的潜在影响。通过将知识产权上链，可以提高其透明度、保护创作者权益、促进创新，并可能开辟新的商业模式。 <div>

It&#8217;s no surprise that the digital currency introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009 focused entirely on decentralization, sovereignty, and verifiability. What followed was nothing short of a monetary revolution: with Turing-complete networks like Ethereum, users could deploy their funds across thousands of DeFi applications instead of relying on centralized actors. Within a decade, the value of onchain financial assets skyrocketed to over $2 trillion, underscoring the importance of true decentralized ownership.</p><p>These days, it is not primarily the financial system that is at stake; another asset class is on the brink of collapse: intellectual property. While the advent of AI has brought immense creative capabilities to users, the speed and scope of user-generated content creation are outpacing a legal system still tied to physical content production. This time, it is not banks milking subprime mortgages for every last drop of revenue, but data-hungry big tech corporations greedily extracting anything they can from their users, disregarding user sovereignty and copyright laws. What could be a digital renaissance is threatening to become a tragedy of the commons.</p><p>Ultimately, the very future of AI itself is at stake. As Chris Dixon observes in his book <em>Read.Write.Own.</em>, artificial intelligence depends on a constant influx of human-made, high-quality content [1]. Neither low-quality content farms nor synthetic data (i.e., data fabricated by AI itself) can provide the foundation necessary to power sophisticated models. However, the current landscape of AI harms the AI-creator relationship, actively disincentivizing the creation of new content rather than encouraging creators to remain the cornerstone of AI systems. When people see their copyrights being breached by the millions, they are not motivated to continue publishing original content, depriving AI models of the very foundation they depend on for training. Thus, the quest for a better IP system is also a quest for the sustainable future of AI. Intellectual property is the key piece of the puzzle that must fall into place for success. If it doesn&#8217;t, the social and economic repercussions could be devastating.</p><h2>The Fragile State of The World&#8217;s Biggest Asset Class</h2><p>Thinking about the current IP landscape in economic terms, it resembles a market with enormous entry barriers, allowing only the top 1% of creators to participate. While almost everyone owns some form of intellectual property, smaller actors are excluded from this system due to the steep legal costs of copyright contracting and negotiation. Politically, the IP regime can be compared to an oligarchy, where a few big franchises, like Disney and Marvel, own the largest share of value creation. This concentration of power stifles innovation: it&#8217;s no wonder we recycle franchise after franchise, year after year.</p><p>However, there&#8217;s another issue: this system of high inertia is slow and outdated. Most copyright laws in place today were created during a time of physical production and are ill-suited to address the demands of automated, autonomous systems. AI models require vast amounts of data for training, to the extent that the manual licensing model cannot keep up. Large AI corporations don&#8217;t break IP laws because they are inherently malicious; they&#8217;ve established web scraping and copyright breaches as their de facto modus operandi because it&#8217;s more cost-effective to pay million-dollar fees than to license content manually. The lack of adaptability in our current system incentivizes the wrong behavior.</p><p>Overall, the current state of intellectual property reveals a highly centralized asset class controlled by a few dominant actors, much like how lending and borrowing were monopolized by banks before DeFi emerged. Meanwhile, the system&#8217;s inertia creates misaligned incentives. How much value are we missing out on when every one of us owns intellectual property but cannot compete? Story aims to tackle these issues by tokenizing the multi-trillion-dollar asset class of intellectual property, making it programmable, sovereign, and liquid.</p><h2>A Multi-Layered, Purpose-Built Architecture</h2><p>Story employs a vertically integrated architecture purpose-built for bringing intellectual property onto the blockchain. It consists of a layer 1 blockchain (Story Network), a smart contract protocol (Proof-of-Creativity Protocol), and a legal framework (Programmable IP License) [2]. These components provide a full-stack foundation for the growing IP-centered application ecosystem, enabling use cases like IPFi, permissionless licensing, automated royalty payments, and more. By innovating across the entire stack, this unique setup serves as the ideal bridge between code and law, enabling truly programmable intellectual property.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d7e6667-e151-4a2f-8940-0ee3b0c51cbb_1600x815.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="742" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d7e6667-e151-4a2f-8940-0ee3b0c51cbb_1600x815.png" width="1456" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><h3>Story Network&#8212;The Infrastructure Layer</h3><p>When first-generation web3 philosopher Andreas M. Antonopoulos published his seminal book on blockchain technology, he titled it <em>The Internet of Money</em> for a reason: money was inherently intertwined with blockchain&#8217;s birth, serving as both the object and subject of a revolutionary movement aimed at fixing a failing financial system [3]. Today, despite the diversification of use cases, financial transactions remain the lifeblood of the Web3 ecosystem, with generalized terms like &#8220;token&#8221; and &#8220;wallet&#8221; serving as vestiges that hearken back to Bitcoin&#8217;s noble founding myth. Additionally, as the &#8220;tokenization of everything&#8221; reveals, we often borrow financial approaches for non-financial uses, such as voting. This monetary-centric paradigm has worked surprisingly well&#8212;until now.</p><p>Intellectual property, however, differs vastly from money. Unlike financial assets, intellectual property is the legal manifestation of ideas, and ideas, by nature, tend to mix, morph, and evolve. They rarely exist in isolation; remixing is a defining characteristic. Intellectual property quickly forms complex parent-child relationships, often growing into intricate trees of immense depth, generating new ideas in the process. Providing attribution for intellectual property is not as simple as looping through a _balances mapping and extracting a hexadecimal public key; it requires traversing a complex tree that can expand as the IP evolves. In such cases, gas costs become the Achilles&#8217; heel, and IP represents an extreme example of these non-financial challenges.</p><p>Story solves this issue by providing a purpose-built layer 1 blockchain optimized specifically for the handling of intellectual property. Story Network treats IP as a first-class citizen, while also bringing technical improvements to a standard EVM execution environment. It leverages precompiled primitives to traverse complex data structures, such as IP graphs, within seconds at marginal costs. Story Network can manage the growing computational demands of downstream royalty payments, efficiently distributing royalties for an IP with hundreds or even thousands of parent IPs&#8212;each of which may also have multiple parent IPs. At the same time, Story is fully EVM-equivalent, allowing developers to bring their existing applications to the platform. The consensus layer is based on the mature CometBFT stack, ensuring fast finality and low transaction costs [4].</p><p>The foundation of a dedicated layer 1 blockchain allows Story to innovate across the entire technical stack. This sets the stage for future integrations, such as a graph database within the execution environment or validator-enshrined technology, like native oracles for NFTs and off-chain real-world assets (RWAs), using Cosmos SDK vote extensions. Story also opens the door to potential rollup support with bespoke cross-chain data (e.g., Initia's model), which is crucial for Web2 applications handling millions of transactions. By introducing purpose-built infrastructure, Story demonstrates that the benefits for the entire ecosystem outweigh the overhead of infrastructure management and positions itself as the ideal foundation for the world&#8217;s IP ledger. The Proof-of-Creativity protocol is another essential element of this vision.</p><h3>Proof-of-Creativity Protocol&#8212;The Smart Contract Layer</h3><p>Natively enshrined into Story&#8217;s layer 1 blockchain, the Proof-of-Creativity (PoC) protocol constitutes the de facto intellectual property onramp designed to make IP programmable. This collection of interwoven smart contracts holds the logic behind all IP-related actions. Here, offchain intellectual property turns into onchain programmable IP, powered by extensible modules that define licensing flows, distribute royalty payouts, and settle disputes, among other things; it contains the registries that hold IP assets, modules, and metadata; and it provides the onchain bridgehead for the real-world legal system, as defined in the license templates. In short: The PoC Protocol is Story&#8217;s operating system, the control room for all IP assets.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff3557221-1010-4551-bb6f-eebcc4bde85c_1600x1304.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="1187" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff3557221-1010-4551-bb6f-eebcc4bde85c_1600x1304.png" width="1456" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Onramps are arguably the most critical pieces of Web3 infrastructure, as they allow mapping real-world assets to their decentralized counterparts, translating offchain realities to onchain transactions. It is onramps that make things we hold dear in our lives seamlessly plug and play into the benefits of decentralized technology. Circle&#8217;s USDC exemplifies how straightforward such an onramp can be for monetary assets: an external party wires US dollars to Circle, where, upon arrival, a blockchain record is created&#8212;one USDC is minted and sent to its particular owner. While the offchain asset provides a backstop for a future offramp, the onchain asset can now move freely across applications.</p><p>For intellectual property, the onramp process starts similarly. At the core of the PoC protocol lies the IP Asset (IPA), an ERC-721 representation of the registered offchain IP stored in the IPAsset registry. Whenever an offchain IP is registered, such an IPA is created. However, as discussed previously, intellectual property is much more complex than monetary assets: royalties need to be distributed, permissionless licensing has to be enabled, and disputes may be settled&#8212;in short, while a USDC token or a PFP NFT is entirely self-sufficient, the IP Asset alone, in its isolated form, demands more complex functionality baked in, namely: the IPA needs to be able to take actions, own royalty tokens, manage license tokens, and much more.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff56bdc3a-363f-4dc6-85aa-53d5573b9b33_972x872.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="872" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff56bdc3a-363f-4dc6-85aa-53d5573b9b33_972x872.png" width="972" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Initially, blockchain accounts were only managed by private keys in the form of EOAs. That changed when the concept of smart contract accounts was introduced. A smart contract account is, in its most basic form, a wallet powered by smart contract code, not a private key. But still, these accounts were bound to individuals or groups that triggered certain transactions. The NFT boom of 2021 saw a myriad of advanced use cases that soon highlighted the necessity of more advanced models, models that would transfer agency to the token level. ERC-6551 finally changed the user-centered paradigm by inventing token-bound accounts, i.e., smart contract accounts owned by an NFT. This empowered tokens themselves to be the agents of their actions.&nbsp;</p><p>IP Assets on Story are equipped with a dedicated token-bound account, the IP Account, upon registration. This modified ERC-6551 implementation gives IPAs the power to trigger actions, which is an essential precondition for IP-centric use cases like royalty payments and licensing. With IP Accounts, an IP Asset can hold its own vault of royalty tokens or carry ERC-721 license tokens that provide the backbone of permissionless licensing. The logic of the specific actions is defined in the PoC protocol&#8217;s modules, which can be considered micro-applications at IP Accounts&#8217; disposal. The various predefined modules contain use-case-specific logic and are referenced in the Module registry. Still, developers may also craft their own modules for particular use cases.&nbsp;</p><p>The <strong>licensing module</strong> manages the process of permissionless licensing. <em>Licensing </em>means granting permission to use or sell intellectual property under specific conditions;<em> permissionless</em> means that this can happen without an intermediary. When creating an IP Asset, a user can attach certain license terms&#8212;derived from a license template&#8212;to their IP that specify legal boundaries like commercial usage, transferability, and much more. Attaching license terms to an IPA allows other users to permissionlessly mint <em>license tokens</em>. These ERC-721 tokens are the onchain, legally binding representation of owning the licensing rights to a particular IP&#8212;if you have a license token, you own the license rights to the specific IP, as defined in its license terms. An IP owner can set a price for minting these license tokens, and hooks allow for advanced use cases like automated price adjustments, and more.&nbsp;</p><p>The <strong>royalty module</strong> is concerned with the distribution of royalties across IP trees. When users register an IP, they can define the royalty share they expect from any derivative IP. When a derivative IP generates revenue, this revenue is distributed across its ancestor tree according to the royalty policy in place. The main way of doing this is using royalty tokens, ERC-20 tokens that represent ownership in royalty payments. The IP Assets themselves own these royalty tokens thanks to the ERC-6551-inspired IP Account implementation. While royalty tokens represent the virtual ownership of royalty payments in an IP tree, revenue tokens pose the actual monetary inflows. They are denoted in their specific currency and can be claimed using royalty tokens.&nbsp;</p><p>While the license and the royalty module provide the heart of the protocol, there are further preconfigured modules. The <strong>dispute module</strong> creates a way for users to raise and resolve disputes through arbitration using arbitration policies, arbitration penalties, and tags. The <strong>collection module</strong> allows the grouping of certain IPs together under the same license terms. This is particularly useful when registering large catalogs of IPs that should all adhere to similar terms, e.g. when providing training data for AI models. Also, royalty payments can be streamlined across multiple IPs using the collection module [5].&nbsp;</p><h3>Programmable IP License&#8212;The Legal Layer</h3><p>The 2008 financial crisis exposed fundamental flaws of the traditional financial system, and rightly so, Bitcoin&#8212;with Ethereum on its heels&#8212;challenged its most basic mainstays. However, as radical as the critique of Satoshi, Vitalik, and their staunch supporters turned out, the idea of an entirely detached, decentralized monetary system has never truly manifested. Today, fiat-backed currencies make up about 90% of stablecoins, contributing around 10-15% to Web3's entire market capitalization. Like it or not, the traditional financial system is still heavily intertwined with the decentralized realm by means of bridges, onramps, stablecoins, or CEXs. But that&#8217;s not necessarily a bad thing. Key innovations like true digital ownership and programmable money are enabled, while the legacy system provides a slow-moving but security-providing backstop, a sturdy foundation.&nbsp;</p><p>Likewise, just as Story&#8217;s vision of programmable IP poses a stark contrast to today&#8217;s real-world, analog, illiquid IP legal system, the idea is not to entirely replace it. Instead, the idea is to onramp IP to the blockchain, where advanced use cases can be achieved, while the legal system acts as a backstop in the background. Because IP is a legal concept, this onramp needs to hook into the legal system, and&#8212;ultimately&#8212;deliver on blockchain&#8217;s fundamental promise: Turning law into code, and treating code as law. The key tool to achieve this is Story&#8217;s Programmable IP License (PIL), the legal layer of its vertically integrated IP stack.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff53cb273-f0d1-423f-bec3-0633755c95a8_1600x540.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="491" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff53cb273-f0d1-423f-bec3-0633755c95a8_1600x540.png" width="1456" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>On a high level, the PIL is a universal license agreement template that bridges real-world IP with its onchain tokenization, the IP Asset. It&#8217;s a legal framework using US copyright law that allows IP owners to set rules for permissionless licensing, commercialization, and remixing of their original creations. It includes a set of parameters that the IP owner can define. Registering an IP on Story, thus, means entering the US legal system by means of the PIL, building a robust and real-world backstop to the free-flowing, onchain IP Asset. Actions taken on Story Network&#8212;e.g., license issuance&#8212;are thereby legally enforceable, intertwining code and law.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3319ec54-4b04-433f-835a-47fd66a2619a_1600x814.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="741" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3319ec54-4b04-433f-835a-47fd66a2619a_1600x814.png" width="1456" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>The technical hook used to interlock the legal world with the PoC protocol is the license module, specifically its license templates. License templates are the abstraction of concretely implemented license terms, which attach to an IP Asset. The smart contract defines parameters that precisely mirror the parameters outlined in the legal agreement. For example, the PIL defines &#8220;commercial use&#8221; in &#167;1, Art. 1 in the Programmable IP License, mirrored in the IPILicenseTemplate.sol contract as the parameter bool commercialUse. The actual choices of these parameters that a user takes when registering their IP are then denoted as the license terms derived from these license templates.&nbsp;</p><p>The PIL is a kickstart legal agreement that already has a license template representation on Story. However, developers can bring their own legal frameworks to Story, generating their dedicated license templates in the process. Ideally, this extensibility will provide a diverse field of options to future users, just as users can choose between multiple stablecoins. This helps to preserve the overall stability of the system and ensures numerous touchpoints with the real-world legal system [6].&nbsp;</p><h3>The Application Ecosystem</h3><p>This technical foundation allows builders to capture the next wave of IP and consumer applications. As of today, 200+ teams totaling 20M+ IPs are building on Story across verticals, including IPFi, AI, and consumer.</p><p><strong><a href="https://magma.com/">Magma</a></strong>, for example, is a suite of browser-based professional design tools that brings real-time creative collaboration to its 3M+ users. Using Story-powered features, creatives can register their work as an IP Asset with a few clicks, generating a blockchain record (ERC-721 token) for their IP. With Story&#8217;s Programmable IP License as a legal bridge, they can then seamlessly set the pricing and permission terms for how their work can be used. Anyone interested in using that work can then accept these legally binding terms and license it in a single click.</p><p>The team of <strong><a href="https://www.mahojin.ai/">Mahojin</a></strong>&#8212;building an open and decentralized version of Hugging Face&#8212;uses Story with a focus on IP tokenization for AI. Data owners, for example, can register their work as IP Assets on Story, equipped with the license terms they favor. AI models can then license big batches of data quickly at marginal cost to train their models. Additionally, AI models themselves can be registered as IP Assets, enabling complex remixes of different models with fair and correct attribution.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.joinsek.ai/">Sekai</a></strong> is an AI storytelling platform that helps storytellers, artists, and fans co-create immersive interactive stories via simple prompts, empowering fans regardless of their creative background. IP owners can create their universe and set the contribution rules, including monetization models. Space Runners&#8217; <strong><a href="https://ablo.ai/">Ablo</a></strong> allows anyone in the world to customize and remix the latest fashion using generative AI tools. It uses Story to handle IP registration, creator attribution, and revenue sharing between designers and brands.</p><p>Beyond that, tokenized IP is making intellectual property accessible for financial participation, unlocking the new sector of IPFi that integrates the world&#8217;s largest asset class into the existing onchain liquidity. That&#8217;s possible because Story uses dedicated tokens to handle licensing (ERC-721) and royalties (ERC-20). Applications can tap into valuable IP assets, for example, by creating liquidity pools for a certain IP&#8217;s royalty tokens or trading its licensing tokens (liquid licensing).</p><h2>Coda</h2><p>This article highlighted the current issues plaguing the intellectual property regime: high inertia, fragmentation, opacity, and cost intensity. It outlined how Story addresses these challenges by bringing IP onto the blockchain, making it programmable, liquid, and sovereign. Story offers a vertically integrated solution, comprising a layer 1 blockchain purpose-built for intellectual property, a dedicated smart contract protocol, a universal IP licensing framework, and an application ecosystem spanning multiple verticals, such as storytelling, AI, and IPFi. Ultimately, Story tokenizes the multi-trillion-dollar asset class of intellectual property, transforming it into a programmable, sovereign, and liquid asset&#8212;turning the internet into an IP Legoland.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Thanks for reading the Stanford Blockchain Review!

<div> 关键词：Circle、USDC、稳定币、监管、数字化支付

<br /><br />
总结:

这篇文章主要探讨了Circle公司发行的稳定币USDC的关键特性、采用情况以及面临的监管挑战。USDC作为区块链行业的一个重要组成部分，通过将美元的稳定性与区块链的可交易性和便捷性相结合，解决了用户如何以数字方式使用美元的问题。其核心优势在于信任和透明度，通过与传统金融机构合作，确保1:1的美元储备支持，并定期接受四大审计公司的独立审计。

USDC在DeFi（去中心化金融）领域有着广泛的应用，同时也在传统金融领域找到了市场，例如通过与Visa和Mastercard的合作，成为了一种主流的支付手段。这显示了稳定币在传统金融和加密货币之间的桥梁作用，为全球用户提供了一种新的价值存储、计价和交换方式。

然而，稳定币也面临着法律和监管方面的挑战，包括防止滥用以进行非法活动的风险。美国的证券交易委员会（SEC）和商品期货交易委员会（CFTC）等监管机构正在努力制定更精细的法规来应对这一新兴领域，同时保护普通用户免受潜在风险的影响。欧盟的《加密资产市场法规》（MiCA）在这方面做出了积极的努力，为稳定币和其他数字资产制定了全面的监管框架。

总的来说，USDC代表了数字货币向传统金融体系融合的重要一步，其发展不仅依赖于技术进步，也需要政策制定者的支持和监管框架的完善，以确保这一创新领域能够健康、可持续地发展。 <div>

Full Video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r289H_4kRxA">here</a>.</em></p><div class="youtube-wrap" id="youtube2-r289H_4kRxA"><div class="youtube-inner"></div></div><h2>Introduction</h2><p>Stablecoins today are a staple of the crypto industry, combining the dollar&#8217;s reliability as a store of value with a blockchain token&#8217;s transactability and ease of use. Among these is USDC, Circle&#8217;s flagship product and one of the most widely adopted stablecoins, and the 6th largest crypto token by Market Cap [1].</p><p>In this article, we will discuss USDC&#8217;s unique features as a stablecoin product, its current adoption as a means of payment, and the regulatory landscape that USDC and other digital assets may face today, and what all this means for the digital future of the dollar.</p><h2>Creating a Stablecoin of Trust and Transparency</h2><p>At its core, USDC solves a very simple issue: how do you buy digital assets with dollars? Before the advent of stablecoins, the solution was to bridge over fiat dollars from the traditional banking system into cryptocurrency exchanges, often a slow, cumbersome, and expensive process. USDC addresses this &#8220;onramping&#8221; issue by creating a &#8220;digital dollar,&#8221; a programmable, tokenized representation of the US Dollar that is backed 1:1 by fiat cash and cash-equivalent assets [2].</p><p>Since its inception in 2018, USDC has grown to become one of the leading stablecoins in the crypto industry. Perhaps the key factor that distinguishes USDC from other major stablecoins is its emphasis on trust and transparency throughout the issuance process. Unlike other stablecoin providers, which are often based overseas and are not regulated, Circle is a wholly US-owned, US-operated company that issues these &#8220;digital dollars.&#8221; Every month, USDC&#8217;s reserve assets undergo an independent attestation by a Big Four accounting firm, and Circle has a public dashboard where anyone can view USDC&#8217;s reserves composition in real time [3]. For example, as of Aug 8, 2024, Circle&#8217;s dashboard records $34.5 billion dollars worth of USDC in circulation [4].&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fee7bc6c5-918a-4b23-83e0-b045d1bc0b1e_1600x1023.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="443.75961538461536" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fee7bc6c5-918a-4b23-83e0-b045d1bc0b1e_1600x1023.png" width="694" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p><em>Circle&#8217;s Reserve Compositions, accessed Aug 8, 2024. Source [4].</em></p><p>So, how are Circle&#8217;s USDC tokens issued and redeemed from this fiat backing? The direct issuance and redemption of USDC are processed through &#8220;Circle Mint&#8221;, an Application Programmable Interface (API) for institutional traders, fintech firms, exchanges, and other corporate businesses. To receive&nbsp;USDC in any amount, a Circle Mint customer initiates a fiat transfer in that amount through its API to Circle&#8217;s USDC reserve account, and Circle issues the equivalent USDC to the customer&#8217;s Circle Mint account. Similarly, when a Circle Mint customer requests a fiat redemption for USDC, Circle will send this USDC to a &#8220;burn address,&#8221; and upon this &#8220;burn event,&#8221; will transfer USD to the business&#8217; linked bank account [2].&nbsp;</p><p>The asset management process also aims to promote trust through leveraging the expertise and transparency of traditional asset managers. In USDC&#8217;s $34.5 billion current reserves [4], $4.5 billion is held at reserve banks, while the remaining $30.1 billion is held in the Circle Reserve Fund, a SEC-registered government money market fund managed by Blackrock that has a 5.29% 7-Day SEC yield [6].</p><p>Fiat-backed stablecoins like USDC stand in stark contrast to the traditional fractional banking system. Whereas most dollars in a bank are backed solely by the bank&#8217;s lending portfolio (which often comprises relatively illiquid and riskier assets), every &#8220;dollar&#8221; of USDC is backed by an equivalent amount of highly liquid cash and cash-equivalent USD assets. In this sense, Circle&#8217;s USDC paves the way for the future of the dollar in a digital setting. Through providing a secure, safe, and innovative infrastructure framework for &#8220;digital dollars,&#8221; Circle aims to reimagine one of the most important assets in the financial world.</p><h2>Adoption of USDC From DeFi to TradFi</h2><p>Of course, the true value of a stablecoin lies in its use. No matter how well-designed or how transparent the product is, the real test for a stablecoin is in its adoption in everyday use cases &#8211; both within blockchain contexts, as well as with traditional payment rails.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7438a9b2-5103-4622-ab9b-9cc802dd69a0_1134x828.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="410.3492063492063" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7438a9b2-5103-4622-ab9b-9cc802dd69a0_1134x828.png" width="562" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p><em>Dune Dashboard of Stablecoin Volume in DeFi [9]</em></p><p>Circle&#8217;s USDC remains the world's largest regulated digital dollar and is natively supporting 16 different blockchains, where it has seen significant usage as a preferred stablecoin for use in DeFi protocols [16] [10]. Amongst these, the largest transaction volumes are on Solana and Ethereum, with the primary use cases being in trading, and other activities in the crypto ecosystem. To ensure compatibility between different supported blockchains, USDC has developed a native interoperability infrastructure for cross-chain transfers, called the Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) [11].</p><p>The interoperability mechanism in CCTP is quite similar to Circle Mint&#8217;s fiat-to-token infrastructure. Currently, CCTP supports 8 different chains, namely: Arbitrum, Avalanche, Base, Ethereum, Noble, OP Mainnet, Polygon PoS, Solana [11]. To transfer USDC from one chain to another, such as from Ethereum to Solana, there are three main steps:</p><ol><li><p>First, USDC is burned on Ethereum, the source chain.</p></li><li><p>Then, the user fetches a signed attestation from Circle to this burn, which acts as a receipt to this &#8220;burn event&#8221;.</p></li><li><p>Circle uses this attestation to authorize the mint of USDC on Solana.</p></li></ol><p>One of the advantages of this burn-and-mint mechanism is that it allows for compatibility across blockchains running different Virtual Machines &#8211; such as EVM for Ethereum and SVM for Solana, enabling use cases such as cross-chain swaps, deposits, and purchases in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) systems.&nbsp;</p><p>But perhaps the most exciting area of growth for USDC is in its adoption beyond just crypto transactions and DeFi products. Traditionally, money has three main functions: <strong>(1) as a store of value, (2) as a unit of account, (3) as a medium of exchange. </strong>USDC has seen growing adoption for all three functions of money in real-world settings.</p><p><strong>As a &#8220;store of value,&#8221; </strong>USDC emerges as a natural solution for people in developing countries without reliable access to either US dollars or a dollar-denominated bank account. In Argentina, where the annual inflation rate surges above 200%, stablecoins have emerged as a major way for citizens to preserve their wealth [12]. In 2023, 60% of crypto purchases in Argentina were for dollar-denominated stablecoins such as USDC, and the country ranks 15th for crypto adoption in the world [12]. In December 2023, Circle also announced a partnership with Brazil&#8217;s Nubank to provide its 85 million customers with access to &#8220;digital dollars&#8221; [13].</p><p><strong>As a &#8220;unit of account,&#8221; </strong>USDC has also advanced significantly over the past few years, as Circle has conducted extensive pilots with Visa and Mastercard, two of the biggest payment processors globally. For example, since 2021, Visa has partnered with Crypto.com to pilot using USDC as a settlement mechanism, and in 2023, Visa announced that it would roll out increased support for USDC settlement, with new merchant acquirers Worldpay and Nuvei and utilizing the Solana blockchain [14]. Similarly, in 2021, Mastercard announced that it would be offering crypto companies the ability to launch branded card offerings, settled with stablecoins such as USDC [15].&nbsp;</p><p><strong>As a &#8220;medium of exchange,&#8221; </strong>USDC can be used today at any Visa terminal through the Coinbase Visa Card. Launched in 2020 for US consumers, this debit card allows consumers to directly spend USDC at any Visa terminal, providing a fiat-like payment experience while earning rewards in crypto [16].</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa05442ad-1eab-43a7-901a-5a32e5373b63_1199x1600.jpeg" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="573.8115095913261" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa05442ad-1eab-43a7-901a-5a32e5373b63_1199x1600.jpeg" width="430" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p><em>Coinbase Visa Card, which allows clients to spend USDC at any Visa terminal. Source: Original Content.</em></p><p>Another example of USDC being used as a &#8220;medium of exchange&#8221; is the Singapore-based Grab app, a ride-hailing, food-delivery, and grocery services superapp in Southeast Asia with over 180 million users. In September 2023, Grab announced that they had partnered with Circle to create a web3 wallet that supports USDC payments and NFT government vouchers and food stamps [17]. Today, consumers can use USDC on Ethereum, and Solana as a means to top up their Grab wallet [18].</p><p>Thus, we see that USDC today is gaining increased support and integrations with traditional payment rails, merging an internet financial system with traditional financial services. But how do stablecoins compare as a means of payment to existing digital payment systems, such as Automated Clearinghouses (ACH)?</p><p>In many existing systems such as ACH, the money and the message moves separately across centralized ledgers [19]. If Alice makes a transaction to Bob via ACH or credit card, a transaction will first be labeled as &#8220;pending&#8221; for up to several days, before it becomes finalized. This is because at the moment of transaction, the system merely emits a &#8220;message&#8221; that a transaction occurred, without moving the money itself. The money is credited asynchronously, sometimes after a delay of several days.</p><p>A key advantage of stablecoin payments over these legacy systems is that the money and the message move at the same time. Thus, when Alice makes a stablecoin transaction to Bob, Bob receives the full amount of the money the instant the transaction message is emitted, just like a cash payment. In this way, stablecoins as a payment mechanism represent a technological leap over many existing settlement solutions, and are far more suited to play the role of a &#8220;digital dollar&#8221; in the future.</p><h2>Legal and Regulatory Perspectives on Stablecoins</h2><p>As with any emerging technology, stablecoins have raised many legal and regulatory questions. As stablecoins such as USDC make their way into the mainstream, one key issue is that they may become a tool for malicious actors to conduct money laundering, terrorism financing, and sanctions evasion. This is particularly important as the rails between traditional financial services and stablecoins mature over time to build a new Internet-based financial system; there needs to be a focus on advancing regulatory compliance for stablecoin products.</p><p>Throughout this piece, we&#8217;ve emphasized how Circle aims for USDC to serve as a regulated, transparent, stablecoin issued by an issuer that prioritizes regulatory compliance. As a regulated money transmitter, Circle complies with relevant FINCEN guidelines and state money transmitter laws, and all US-based users of Circle Mint are subject to anti-money laundering and know-your-customer regulations such as the Patriot Act [20].&nbsp;</p><p>But while it is necessary to introduce compliance to prevent abuse of stablecoins such as USDC by malicious actors, this regulation should be more sophisticated and fine-tuned to also protect the interests of everyday consumers that wish to use USDC; creating a regulatory system that shuts out everyday consumers - especially those already marginalized by the existing financial system - does not advance American interests.</p><p>Today, the two main regulatory bodies that are attempting to regulate stablecoins in the US &#8211; the Securities and Exchange Commision (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) &#8211; were created far before the invention of the modern Internet, let alone digital assets such as cryptocurrencies and stablecoins. Regulators today are working with tools from over 90 years ago, and while some guidelines remain useful in certain cases, regulators need to be especially thoughtful on how to apply existing rules to this novel industry and create new rules to effectively regulate activities that are novel based on the innovations of blockchain technology.</p><p>Although the blockchain industry can make some technical innovations, such as decentralized digital identity systems, which&nbsp; make it easier to balance end-users&#8217; demands for privacy with regulatory requirements, this alone will not be enough to fill this regulatory gap. It is up to Congress to act in order to increase regulatory transparency for both stablecoins and for digital assets at large, and new legislation such as the draft of the Stablecoin Transparency Act represent steps in the right direction [21].</p><p>In this regard, several other jurisdictions, including the European Union, are much farther ahead than the United States. Recently, the EU has introduced the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), which is set to be fully implemented by December 2024 [22]. The core innovation with MiCA is that it seeks to create a whole new regulatory framework built for digital assets, with provisions such as mandating liquid reserves for stablecoin issuers, limitations on non-euro denominated stablecoins, and a unified authorization regime for the EU&#8217;s 450 million citizens. MiCA represents a significant step in increasing regulatory clarity around both stablecoin and digital asset regulation [22], and Circle&#8217;s stablecoins are the first global stablecoins&nbsp; that are complaint&nbsp; under MiCA [23].Based on their work to comply with MiCa, Circle&#8217;s products are&nbsp; well-positioned to gain adoption in the EU as a leading compliant stablecoin.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6dea63be-a969-4998-a3e0-5bba52b9cdea_811x573.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="573" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6dea63be-a969-4998-a3e0-5bba52b9cdea_811x573.png" width="811" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p><em>Largest Foreign US Treasury Holders. Source [24].</em></p><p>Thus, there is a great incentive for the US Congress to act on stablecoin legislation. A regulated, dollar-denominated stablecoin such as USDC can greatly advance American interests in the digital asset space. USDC&#8217;s reserves mandate means that there will always be a natural demand for US Treasuries. As of June 2024, stablecoins are the 18th largest holder of US debt, holding more T-Bills than South Korea or Germany [24]. And as demand for stablecoins and digital assets grows, this number will only increase. In other words, demand for US-denominated stablecoins directly translates into demand for US dollars and US debt. Therefore, it is imperative that Congress increases regulatory clarity for the digital asset space, to further strengthen the power of the dollar in the digital age.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Stablecoins such as USDC have come a long way since their inception just a few years ago, emerging as one of blockchain technology&#8217;s most compelling use cases. The core idea of a stablecoin is to bring the interoperability, composability, and accessibility of the Internet to the legacy institutions of money, and USDC leads the way in building a safe and transparent &#8220;digital dollar.&#8221;</p><p>In the next few years, as stablecoin products, adoption, and regulation mature and develop, we can expect millions of businesses and people adopting a new open standard for financial transactions. In this sense, Circle&#8217;s mission is to fulfill the unfinished promise of the Internet &#8211; to bring the Internet&#8217;s openness and transparency to the realm of money to ultimately build an Internet financial system [25].</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Thanks for reading the Stanford Blockchain Review!

<div> 关键词：Base、EIP-4844、BRETT、memecoin、用户行为

总结:

文章通过分析区块链网络中的供需关系，以Base网络为例，深入探讨了EIP-4844实施后，尤其是BRETT memecoin事件对网络的影响。以下是主要要点的总结：

1. **供需动态**：Base网络作为一个具有固有容量限制的区块链网络，其交易需求的增长导致了竞争加剧和潜在的网络拥堵。当网络容量受到挑战时，交易费用成为关键因素。

2. **EIP-4844与Base**：虽然EIP-4844旨在提高网络容量并降低Layer-2s的交易成本，但随后Base网络经历了异常高的交易量和gas价格，这表明供应冲击可能在特定时刻影响了网络的供需平衡。

3. **BRETT memecoin事件**：BRETT memecoin的推出引发了一波交易热潮，对Base网络产生了显著影响。这一事件不仅导致了gas费用的显著增加，还改变了用户的交易行为，使得用户对高交易成本更为敏感。

4. **用户行为分析**：通过对非BRETT相关用户行为的数据分析，研究发现BRETT事件导致了用户交易量的减少，表明用户对高gas费用的反应比预期更为强烈。这种反应揭示了用户对区块链网络费用的敏感度以及他们在面对外部冲击时的行为模式。

5. **结论与展望**：文章强调了理解区块链网络中供需动态的重要性，特别是如何应对由外部事件引发的供需冲击。通过分析如BRETT事件这样的案例，可以更好地预测用户行为，为网络设计和优化提供依据，从而提高网络的整体稳定性和用户体验。

文章通过实证分析展示了区块链网络中供需动态的复杂性及其对外部事件的敏感性，为区块链领域的研究提供了宝贵的见解。 <div>

However, for researchers, these disruptions offer valuable opportunities to understand market dynamics that are otherwise hard to disentangle. For instance, because prices and quantities are the observed outcomes of supply and demand, it's hard to know whether supply, demand, or both have an impact. This gives rise to the old saying "don't reason from a price change." But when one or the other factor suddenly changes in a predictable way, sometimes you can.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcfd69f9f-ba97-43f3-b22f-0561728b9f63_1600x900.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="supply_shock" class="sizing-normal" height="819" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcfd69f9f-ba97-43f3-b22f-0561728b9f63_1600x900.png" title="supply_shock" width="1456" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>For example, a <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w27137/w27137.pdf">study </a>from NBER uses the COVID-19 supply shock to understand demand dynamics, showing how such sudden external shocks can serve as significant reallocation forces affecting jobs and sales within the U.S. economy.

Each block has a fixed capacity for transaction data, rendering space a limited resource. As transaction demands escalate, the competition for block space intensifies, leading to potential network congestion.</p><p>In March, the implementation of EIP-4844 aimed to enhance network capacity and lower transaction costs for Ethereum&#8217;s Layer-2s, benefiting networks like Arbitrum and Optimism with significant gas price reductions [1]. However, shortly after this implementation, Base experienced a surge in gas prices, exceeding previous levels observed before EIP-4844 was introduced.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8626f521-ca1a-4573-9987-be279609f7c8_1954x900.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="671" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8626f521-ca1a-4573-9987-be279609f7c8_1954x900.png" width="1456" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>During this period, there was a notable increase in user activity on Base, primarily fueled by DeFi trading activities. This surge was particularly unexpected given that Base's ecosystem has been cultivated to favor consumer-oriented applications. Initially incubated by the Coinbase team, Base has benefitted from extensive marketing and branding efforts aimed at creating a chain that encourages creators, builders, and community engagement. As a result, the ecosystem predominantly consists of consumer apps, with the most successful applications, like Friend.tech, being consumer-oriented.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1eccc3d9-51f6-46df-b76d-e1e969b4b852_1960x954.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="709" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1eccc3d9-51f6-46df-b76d-e1e969b4b852_1960x954.png" width="1456" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>The reversal in user activity and sudden surge in trading on Base could potentially be attributed to a supply shock, induced by an unexpected external event that impacted the system&#8217;s supply chain. Such shocks can significantly alter availability and costs, fundamentally changing user behavior and network dynamics.</p><h2>Catalyst Hunting</h2><p>In order to qualify as a genuine supply shock, the event must be exogenous, unexpected, and sufficiently potent to disrupt established market dynamics.</p><p>Following the implementation of EIP-4844, one of the most significant changes was the sudden increase in DEX trading, which expanded beyond the typical stablecoins and ETH to encompass new tokens. Previously, trading on Base had predominantly focused on these categories, with meme tokens accounting for less than 15% on average of the weekly trading volume across all DEXs.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcdc5e5a5-b450-4a09-be8b-a987f962ed17_1772x816.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="670" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcdc5e5a5-b450-4a09-be8b-a987f962ed17_1772x816.png" width="1456" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Historically, memecoin seasons are often ignited by a "beacon" token that captures significant market interest and sets new trading benchmarks. This phenomenon is likely driven by factors like information cascades [2]. On platforms like Crypto Twitter, successful trading stories are amplified, while failures are often ignored, leading to a skewed perception of potential gains. As traders observe and imitate the actions of others, assuming they have valuable insights, a self-reinforcing loop is created. This drives up the prices of memecoins rapidly and often leads to significant market volatility.</p><p>For example, in late 2023 on Solana, the dogwifhat token (WIF) rose from a market cap of less than $1 million to billions within months [3]. The success of WIF inspired a memecoin mania on Solana, marked by an increase in meme token launches and the development of memecoin infrastructure [4].</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0aeae3cf-a9bb-405e-9c0d-228401fe3172_1978x956.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="704" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0aeae3cf-a9bb-405e-9c0d-228401fe3172_1978x956.png" width="1456" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>While memecoins have existed on Base since it first launched, none of them captured market mindshare until March of this year. Base's initial mainnet launch was fueled by a memecoin trading frenzy [5]. Prior to the official launch of the network, thousands of users migrated to Base to trade meme coins. The activity on these tokens tapered down as new applications started to launch. Inspired by a character from a popular book featuring Pepe, the BRETT token launched in late February to early March quickly made its mark on Base, achieving a market capitalization of $350 million well before significant meme trading activity took hold [5]. Its rapid rise not only distinguished it from typical market trends but also ignited a broader trading frenzy across the network.</p><p>The initial success of the BRETT token drew speculative traders through potential mimetic effects, attracting a new cohort of users more interested in meme trading than in engaging with the network's applications. Although this group's focus has remained narrow, it is valuable to explore the ripple effects of this meme frenzy on the existing user base of Base's ecosystem, particularly how their typical behaviors shifted in response to this event. That said, while surface-level data alone cannot confirm that the observed congestion directly resulted from the BRETT token event, it does encourage us to pursue a more detailed analysis to accurately assess the direct impacts on user behavior and demand.</p><h2>The Experiment:</h2><p>The primary objective of the proposed experiment is to analyze the supply and demand dynamics on Base, focusing on how gas fees (supply) and transaction activity (demand) interact before, during, and after the BRETT event. A critical aspect of this analysis involves isolating the impact of the BRETT launch from general market behavior.</p><p>To gain clear insights into market dynamics, we will exclude trading activity directly related to the BRETT token. Our analysis will concentrate on addresses that were active prior to the token&#8217;s launch in late February, enabling us to evaluate a consistent user base unaffected by the speculative interest that new tokens often generate. This approach ensures that our examination of broader user behavior on Base remains unbiased, not disproportionately influenced by those primarily interested in BRETT.</p><h3>The Model:</h3><p>In this study, we utilize a regression model with a core binary variable to analyze the impact of the BRETT launch. The selection of variables and their functions within the model are chosen to reflect the nuanced effects of this market event.</p><p>The model is defined as follows:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa10f00bd-7e7a-4310-a9fc-0934dc935f90_802x112.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="112" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa10f00bd-7e7a-4310-a9fc-0934dc935f90_802x112.png" width="802" /><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Where:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Average Gas Usage</strong> (&#119876;&#119905;): Represents the average gas usage at time &#119905;, serving as a key indicator of transaction complexity and network load.</p></li><li><p><strong>Shock Indicator</strong> (&#119863;&#119905;): A binary variable that indicates whether the BRETT token event occurred (0 if before the launch, 1 otherwise).</p></li><li><p><strong>Gas Fee</strong> (&#119875;&#119905;): Denotes the price of gas in gwei at time &#119905;.</p></li><li><p><strong>Interaction Term</strong> (&#119863;&#119905;&#119875;&#119905;): Captures the interaction between the BRETT shock and the gas prices.</p></li><li><p><strong>Transaction Count</strong> (&#119879;&#119905;): Denotes the number of transactions at time &#119905;, included to understand how variations in transaction volume influence network congestion and gas usage.</p></li></ul><p>It's important to acknowledge that this model, in its current form, is somewhat simplistic and primarily serves to suggest shifts in demand related to this specific catalyst. The model does not account for potential endogeneity stemming from baseline conditions or other underlying trends, which could obscure the true causality and elasticity of demand prior to the event. For instance, omitted variables may exist, and there could be simultaneous causality between gas usage and fees, along with additional noise that could compromise the accuracy of our initial estimates.</p><p>However, this model enables us to determine whether the BRETT shock led to a statistically significant change in transaction behavior on Base, independent of BRETT's direct trading activities.</p><h2>Regression Results</h2><p>Looking at non-BRETT specific cohort of users from early January 2024 until the end of May on an hourly basis, we can deduce the following surrounding the launch and first run up of the BRETT token:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F46b66a0f-9e7a-4fb1-9086-6bb31141c324_1600x900.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="meme_model" class="sizing-normal" height="819" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F46b66a0f-9e7a-4fb1-9086-6bb31141c324_1600x900.png" title="meme_model" width="1456" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Following the Brett token's introduction on Base, there was a statistically significant behavioral shift among users in response to rising gas prices. The regression model indicated a significant negative interaction term (&#120573;3=&#8722;0.333) which suggests that the increase in gas fees after the token's introduction likely deterred user transactions.</p><p>Specifically, the interaction term suggests that for a one standard deviation increase in gas prices (&#916;&#119875;=1.2&#215;105 gwei) following the meme event, we can expect a decrease in gas usage, &#916;&#119876;, of 41.2k, which corresponds to 79% of the typical hourly standard deviation. In other words, according to the model, a one standard deviation increase in gas prices results in approximately a 0.79 standard deviation decrease in demand during a high congestion event.</p><p>Overall, the introduction of the memecoin beacon token, BRETT, had adverse ripple effects on Base's initial user base. The catalyst-induced congestion heightened this cohort's sensitivity to rising gas prices, making them more averse to transaction costs&#8212;even though these costs were close to levels observed prior to the implementation of EIP-4844.</p><h2>Zooming Out</h2><p>The ripple effects of BRETT on Base serves as an illustration of the broader vulnerabilities and adaptive behaviors characteristic of crypto ecosystems. This event underscores how emergent tokens, and more particularly unexpected events, can substantially affect transaction metrics, user behavior, and network stability, illustrating the rapid pace at which dynamics can evolve within a blockchain's operational framework.</p><p>This incident highlights the nuanced relationship between supply (in this case, network fees) and user demand, which is far from a simple linear equation. Demand can shift abruptly, as evidenced by the BRETT event, or evolve more gradually as the ecosystem matures. Such shifts underscore the complex interplay between network adjustments and user responses, which are not always predictable and can vary widely depending on external shocks or anticipated changes like network upgrades.</p><p>Looking ahead, as more exogenous events or known upgrades occur, understanding these underlying dynamics becomes vital. Recognizing the patterns and potential reactions of users to changes within the ecosystem can help in forecasting more genuine user dynamics and responses.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Thanks for reading the Stanford Blockchain Review!

<br /><br />
总结:
文章主要探讨了Vitalik Buterin、Hitzig和Weyl提出的广义投票算法在实现公共物品最优分配中的应用——广义资助机制。该机制通过赞助者匹配去中心化社区个体捐赠者的贡献来分配公共物品资金。文章首先证明了在理想条件下，广义资助机制可以达到最优资源分配。随后，文章指出四个可能导致机制结果次优的条件：信息不对称、合谋、欺诈和赞助方资金不足。

信息不对称意味着参与者对项目质量的看法存在差异，这可能影响他们的投票行为，导致效率损失。合谋则涉及参与者之间私下达成协议以获取自身利益，损害其他参与者利益。欺诈指的是误导性地声称自己为多个账户进行投票，从而获得不成比例的利益。赞助方资金不足则是指实际提供的资金可能不足以达到社会最优分配。

最后，文章以Gitcoin Grants为例，这是一个真实世界中应用广义资助机制的案例，展示其在开放源代码软件项目和其他以太坊区块链生态系统中的公共物品融资。尽管当前活动水平似乎较低，但Gitcoin Grants作为广义资助机制从学术论文到实际应用的案例，展示了DAO模型提供创新治理平台的灵活性与潜力。 <div>

Vitalik Buterin, Hitzig, and Weyl provides a generalization of the quadratic voting algorithm to a mechanism for achieving the socially optimal allocation of public goods [2]. The algorithm, known as quadratic funding, involves a sponsor/donor that matches the contributions of a decentralized community of individual donors. Under the quadratic funding mechanism, the total funds allocated to a public good project equals the square of the sum of the square-roots of individual contributions.</p><p>In this paper I begin by providing a simple mathematical proof that, under idealized conditions, the quadratic funding mechanism achieves the first-best allocation of public goods. Then I describe four deviations from these idealized conditions that may lead to suboptimal results for the quadratic funding mechanism. These limitations are asymmetric information, collusion, fraud, and underfunding by the donor. Finally, I discuss Gitcoin Grants, a real-world application of the quadratic funding mechanism.</p><h2><strong>The Quadratic Funding Model</strong></h2><p>This section will provide a brief summary of the model that underlies the quadratic funding model for the allocation of funds for public goods. I begin with deriving the first-best resource allocation of a central planner, and then demonstrate that the quadratic funding model can implement the central planner&#8217;s funding levels across public goods in a decentralized setting. The derivation will be mostly at a heuristic level, and omit some of the finer details such as second-order conditions.</p><p>Let there be P public goods, indexed with p = 1, 2, ..., P. The central planner chooses funding levels Fp for each of the public goods. Public good p provides utility value of Vp(Fp). The planner then chooses to maximize:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66ca8245-6d02-4226-ac4c-09ae052f0e36_1302x204.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="204" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66ca8245-6d02-4226-ac4c-09ae052f0e36_1302x204.png" width="1302" /><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>The first-order condition is:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81db2708-2f0d-4723-84a1-ddf3ba6316c5_1322x138.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="138" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81db2708-2f0d-4723-84a1-ddf3ba6316c5_1322x138.png" width="1322" /><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Thus, the planner will choose to fund each of the public goods up to the point at which the marginal benefit of the last dollar of funding equals its marginal cost.</p><p>Now, consider the funding of public goods under a decentralized system with quadratic funding.

planner.</p><h2><strong>Issues with Quadratic Funding&nbsp;</strong></h2><h3>Asymmetric Information</h3><p>One important assumption underlying the ability of quadratic voting to achieve the optimal aggregate allocation is that voters are certain about the underlying quality of the projects on which they vote. That is, while voters are allowed to have different preferences, they all agree on the quality of the projects. However, in reality, voters will hold asymmetric information about the quality of the projects. For example, suppose a particular public good is a sponsored coding contest for an algorithm for the allocation of kidney donations. Voters are likely to differ on their assessment of how likely the coding contest will result in a functional algorithm, and if so, how much better it will be over the status quo. In such settings, we seek both allocative and informational efficiencies.</p><p>Benhaim, Falk, and Tsoukalas analyze quadratic funding under asymmetric information [3]. They begin with the previously demonstrated result that under full information, quadratic voting achieves allocative efficiency. However, this is not generally true under quality uncertainty. Here is the basic intuition. Under quality certainty, the weighting scheme under quadratic voting, where the cost of acquiring voting power is convex, permits voters&#8217; preferences to aggregate with just the right amount of voting power to achieve first-best. However, under uncertainty, we are looking at more than just aggregating preferences. In particular, we wish to aggregate asymmetric information so that the &#8220;wisdom of the crowd&#8221; can best be heard. That is not true under quadratic voting, where voters are seen to have a diminished incentive to have their beliefs aggregated.</p><p>BFT finds that under asymmetric information, quadratic voting can actually underperform traditional linear voting. This is due to the fact that quadratic voting&#8217;s cost convexity can disincentivize voters from casting enough votes to reflect their beliefs. However, as the number of voters increases towards infinity, both quadratic voting and linear voting lead to efficient aggregation of voter information. This suggests that under conditions in which information asymmetry is greatest, designers of the voting system should focus on increasing user participation. For example, they could provide explicit rewards for voter participation. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h3><strong>Collusion</strong></h3><p>Collusion refers to agreements between contributors so as to benefit themselves at the expense of other token holders. Such agreements can be either tacit or explicit, with tacit agreements obviously being difficult to detect. In essence, coordination between large voting blocs can enable the siphoning off of public benefits to the colluding agents. BHW admits that collusion is a central vulnerability of quadratic funding.</p><p>Let me give a simple game-theoretic example of collusion, drawn from Pasquini. Consider a one-shot game between two contributors, voting on two projects, each with a material interest in the funding of one of the two projects. Contributors 1 and 2 each have c funds to invest. The total amount of funds raised by project 1 goes to contributor 1, and the total amount of funds raised by project 2 goes to contributor 2.</p><p>Each contributor can either cooperate or not cooperate. Cooperation means that the contributor gives c/2 to each project. Not cooperating means giving c to their own project, and nothing to the other.</p><p>Consider the 4 possible payoffs:</p><p><br /><strong> A.</strong> If both cooperate, then each project&#8217;s funding under the quadratic rule equals &nbsp; If both cooperate, then each project&#8217;s funding under the quadratic rule equals&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a

width="1160" /><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>It is easy to see that the only (pure) Nash Equilibrium is for neither to cooperate, leading to an equilibrium payoff of zero to each voter. This is just a case of Prisoner&#8217;s Dilemma, in which both would be better cooperating and earning c, but cooperating is dominated by not cooperating. The intuition from this game is why BHW state that &#8220;unilateral incentives run quite strongly against certain forms of collusion.&#8221;</p><p>However, if this mechanism becomes part of an infinitely repeated game, then we know that (under certain parameter restrictions on discounting) that the cooperative outcome can be sustained under the standard &#8220;tit-for-tat&#8221; equilibrium. Such strategies would take the form of cooperating with the threat that any deviation would be met by thereafter not cooperating. This result could be a major problem for applications that permit the threat of non-cooperating to permit a cooperative dynamic equilibrium. Notice that Gitcoin Grants has been repeated many times.</p><h3>Fraud</h3><p>BHW also lists fraud as a central vulnerability of quadratic funding. In fact, when comparing fraud to collusion, they call fraud the &#8220;simpler and more devastating of the issues.&#8221; Because of the convexity of the quadratic function, there is a built-in incentive to misrepresent oneself fraudulently as many individuals. This is sometimes termed a &#8220;Sybil attack.&#8221;</p><p>BHW offers this simple example. Consider a single voter contemplating offering to contribute $20x to a project (in which they have a personal stake). If she is able to misrepresent herself as 20 voters contributing $x apiece, she will pay $20x but her cause (which goes to her) receives</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F51afa7ab-0bda-437b-8479-15395f8412c4_198x54.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="47.45454545454545" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F51afa7ab-0bda-437b-8479-15395f8412c4_198x54.png" width="174" /><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>That is, her individual contribution grows 20-fold. If this kind of fraud is permitted, then we have a clear arbitrage which will entirely upset the honesty of the voting system.</p><p>BHW suggests that the only meaningful system of preventing such fraud is an effective system of identity verification, which may not be trivial in a DAO setting which is often designed to preserve anonymity. In addition, there needs to be actual auditing of voting results with sufficient penalties against fraud to deter the urge to exploit.</p><h3>Underfunding</h3><p>Under the quadratic funding mechanism, the role of the sponsor/donor is critical. Recall that the mechanism selects the amount of funding for public goods projects through applying the quadratic rule to individual contributions and using the sponsor funds to reach the resulting implied levels. In reality, the pool of funds provided by the donor is likely to be less than what is needed to reach socially optimal allocations. This is the problem analyzed in Pasquini.</p><p>The problem of limited donor funds was addressed by BHW. To address this limitation, they discuss a mechanism called &#8220;capital constrained quadratic funding&#8221; which essentially makes the public good as large as matching funds allow, and still proportional to the rules of quadratic funding. In fact, this is the implementation used in Gitcoin Grants.</p><p>Pasquini shows that capital constrained quadratic funding fails to achieve optimality. That is, even given the constraint, the quadratic funding rule fails to allocate funds in a socially optimal fashion. It is shown that results from the fact that in the constrained equilibrium, individual contributions are lower as they are not fully compensated for the social benefits they generate through their contributions. That is, the constraint impacts the incentives of the individual voter and causes a deviation from the necessary first-order optimality conditions.</p><h2><strong>Gitcoin Grants</strong></h2><p>Perhaps the most famous example of a real-world application of the quadratic funding mechanism is Gitcoin Grants. Gitcoin Grants is a method of funding open-source software projects as well as other public goods on the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem. Open-source software is an excellent example of a public good. It is non-rivalrous in that the benefits of the software do not decline due to others&#8217; consumption. It is non-excludable as open-source software is freely available to the public, regardless of whether they contribute or not.</p><p>According to Yash Agarwal, Gitcoin has facilitated more than $72.8 million in funding for open-source software [5]. In addition, Agarwal provides a simple example of how Gitcoin utilizes the quadratic funding algorithm, which in practice is actually a variant of the capital constrained quadratic funding mechanism proposed in BHW.</p><p>Gitcoin Grants explicitly uses the quadratic funding algorithm. Pasquini illustrates the Gitcoin process employed during the 7th and 8th Gitcoin Grants rounds that took place in 2020. During the days of a round, contributors could find the participating projects described on a webpage, choose which projects in which to invest, and commit a cryptocurrency transfer. The webpage is updated to report the total amount received thus far, as well as the expected amount to be received after matching funds (under quadratic funding) are added. For example, in Round 8 there were 444 projects and 4,953 contributors. Individual contributions per project averaged about 30 DAI.</p><p>The Gitcoin Grants public webpage for its financing platform is instructive. Gitcoin Grants has collected 4.6 million unique donations with 5,242 projects having raised funds [6]. That being said, the level of current activity on the site seems underwhelming. For example, many of the projects (even with less than a week remaining in their round) have raised less than $100. In addition, the amount of funds available in the matching pool is also often small, with many less than $1,000.</p><p>Thus, while Gitcoin Grants may currently be a relatively minor player in public goods financing, it truly is a living and breathing example of quadratic funding. In a sense, it is a remarkable accomplishment that a funding algorithm moved from an academic working paper to real world application in a matter of just a few years. This serves as a testament to the flexibility of the DAO model to provide a testing ground and an openness for novel platforms for governance.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Thanks for reading the Stanford Blockchain Review!

This proposal [1] ignited intense debate and a clash of interests involving stakeholders such as LayerZero, Wormhole, and Andreessen Horowitz. The saga provided a unique cross-section into the complexities of decentralized governance, the influence of venture capital in the DeFi space, and broader implications for the future of blockchain governance.&nbsp;</p><p>The strategic and financial implications of deploying Uniswap V3 on the BNB Chain, coupled with the technical debate over bridge technologies, highlight the intricate balance needed between innovation, security, and community engagement. This decision underscores the necessity for comprehensive governance reforms to mitigate the disproportionate influence of large stakeholders like a16z, ensuring fair and decentralized decision-making. This case exemplifies the broader challenges facing DeFi projects in maintaining transparency, fostering decentralized governance, and advancing cross-chain interoperability.</p><h2><strong>Setting the Scene</strong></h2><p>The proposal to deploy Uniswap V3 on the BNB Chain emerged in early 2023. Proponents suggested that expanding to the BNB Chain would allow Uniswap to tap into a new user base, which in turn means that Uniswap could leverage lower transaction costs, and benefit from faster transaction speeds compared to Ethereum. The initial temperature check on this proposal garnered overwhelming support from the community, indicating a strong desire for Uniswap to diversify its platform presence and enhance its competitive edge in the DeFi ecosystem.</p><p>Deploying on the BNB Chain was seen as a strategic move to capitalize on Binance's vast ecosystem. The BNB Chain offered lower gas fees and faster transaction speeds compared to Ethereum, making it an attractive option for both users and developers. Proponents highlighted that this move could democratize access to Uniswap&#8217;s offerings, making it more accessible to a broader range of users who might have been deterred by Ethereum&#8217;s high transaction costs.</p><p>Lowered transaction costs were a significant factor driving the proposal. On Ethereum, gas fees can be extremely high, especially during periods of network congestion. The BNB Chain's lower fees were expected to attract more users to Uniswap, increasing its liquidity and trading volume. Additionally, the faster transaction speeds on the BNB Chain would improve the overall user experience, making it more competitive with other DEXs already operating on Binance's network.</p><p>Another motivation was the potential to tap into Binance's extensive user base. Binance, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, had a thriving ecosystem with millions of active users. This strategic expansion was seen to enhance Uniswap&#8217;s market presence and solidify its position as a leading DeFi platform. Deploying Uniswap on the BNB Chain can significantly expand Uniswap's user base by tapping into BNB's large and growing community, leveraging its high transaction speeds and low fees. The integration can enhance liquidity and trading volume, providing Uniswap with a potential $1 billion in TVL and attracting 1-2 million new users [1]. Moreover, it offers opportunities for collaboration within BNB&#8217;s ecosystem, improved DeFi infrastructure, and the possibility of integrating with Binance&#8217;s extensive range of products and services, boosting Uniswap&#8217;s overall adoption and functionality.</p><h2><strong>The Fireworks</strong></h2><p>The initial temperature check showed strong support for the deployment, with 20 million votes in favor and participation from 6,495 UNI holders, the highest in Uniswap governance history. This strong endorsement highlighted the community&#8217;s interest in expanding Uniswap&#8217;s reach, leveraging BNB Chain's lower transaction costs and faster speeds, and enhancing its competitive edge in the DeFi space. The proposal projected a significant boost in liquidity and market presence, with a potential $1 billion increase in TVL and the acquisition of 1-2 million new users [2].</p><p>Overwhelming approval from the Uniswap community signaled a collective interest in expanding Uniswap&#8217;s reach and enhancing its competitive edge within the DeFi space. Many community members saw the deployment as a way to diversify Uniswap&#8217;s platform and reduce its dependence on Ethereum. This sentiment was driven by a desire to mitigate the risks associated with high Ethereum gas fees and network congestion, which had become significant pain points for users.</p><p>A critical component of the deployment was the selection of the bridging technology that would facilitate interoperability between Uniswap on the BNB Chain and Ethereum. Two primary contenders emerged: Wormhole and LayerZero. This decision was not merely technical, it also had strategic and financial implications.</p><p>LayerZero, despite being newer to the scene, had quickly gained traction due to its innovative approach to cross-chain communication. LayerZero&#8217;s ULN architecture promised to reduce the attack surface and improve transaction speeds. For a16z, which had invested heavily in projects prioritizing security and scalability, LayerZero represented a forward-looking choice that could enhance Uniswap&#8217;s security posture and future-proof its interoperability capabilities.</p><p>LayerZero is a cross-chain communication protocol designed to provide seamless interoperability between different blockchain networks using its Ultra Light Node (ULN) architecture, allowing efficient and secure cross-chain transactions without the need for full nodes. ULN operates by leveraging a decentralized system of oracles and relayers to validate transactions. Oracles provide data from different blockchains, while relayers transmit this data, ensuring security and trustlessness by requiring both parties to verify transaction details before processing.

Wormhole is a well-established cross-chain bridge known for its robustness and reliability in facilitating secure and efficient cross-chain transactions. It employs a decentralized network of guardians to verify and facilitate transactions, ensuring security and trustlessness. Despite a significant security breach in February 2022, where 120,000 wrapped Ether worth approximately $321 million was stolen [3], Wormhole has since implemented substantial security improvements.&nbsp;</p><p>Its validator set comprises reputable entities and robust security thresholds, making it a trusted solution within the DeFi ecosystem. Wormhole supports Uniswap deployments on several chains, including BNB, Celo, Gnosis, Rootstock, and Moonbeam, ensuring secure and reliable cross-chain communication. The use of Wormhole in Uniswap&#8217;s Sei deployment aims to maintain high security and efficiency in Uniswap's cross-chain operations, enhancing interoperability and functionality across different blockchain networks.</p><p>Stanford Blockchain Club (SBC) provided our analysis of deploying Uniswap V3 on the BNB Chain at the time, evaluating LayerZero and Wormhole for cross-chain governance. We recommend a temporary adoption of LayerZero, conditional on resolving specific issues, while advocating for a long-term solution involving multi-message aggregation. Both LayerZero and Wormhole have governance risks: LayerZero's 2/2 multisig includes Uniswap and LayerZero Labs, and Wormhole's 1/1 multisig involves 19 validators. Despite improvements, neither bridge fully meets our standards, underscoring the need for continuous evaluation and development.</p><p>LayerZero's ULN architecture allows efficient cross-chain transactions without full nodes, using decentralized oracles and relayers for validation. Its temporary adoption is suggested if it resolves certain issues, aiming for a long-term multi-message aggregation solution for better scalability and security. Wormhole, despite its significant security improvements following a major breach in 2022, still presents governance risks. It uses a 1/1 multisig setup with 19 validators but requires continuous assessment and development to meet our criteria. The full detailed post can be found here [4].&nbsp;</p><p>a16z has heavily invested in LayerZero, citing the ULN architecture which enables efficient and secure cross-chain transactions, addressing the Bridging Trilemma and enhancing dApp interoperability as a key factor [5], leading a $135 million funding round alongside FTX and Sequoia Capital. This strategic investment aligns a16z&#8217;s interests with LayerZero&#8217;s success, positioning the protocol as a key part of a16z's portfolio. Additionally, Uniswap Labs, the developer of the decentralized exchange Uniswap, raised $165 million in a Series B funding round led by a16z with participation from Polychain Capital [6]. The significant investments in both LayerZero and Uniswap highlight a16z's influential role in the DeFi space and the potential conflict of interest given their vested interests in both protocols.&nbsp;</p><p>In January 2023, the proposal was voted in an off-chain temperature check conducted on Snapshot. The community preferences indicated a strong preference for Wormhole over LayerZero and other contenders with Wormhole receiving 28M votes when compared to the 17M of LayerZero [7]. Despite Wormhole's past security issues, the community showed confidence in Wormhole&#8217;s subsequent improvements and security measures.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe96aba18-4105-472a-bc74-2d4b19daa53a_514x426.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="A screenshot of a graph

Despite a16z's opposition and advocacy for LayerZero, resulting in a heated debate from February 1-5, the final on-chain vote from February 4-10 saw overwhelming community support for Wormhole. The proposal passed with over 45 million votes in favor, while the opposition, led by a16z, managed around 15 million votes against.</p><p>The governance vote for the BNB Chain deployment highlighted the challenges and intricacies of decentralized decision-making. The final vote was a testament to the power dynamics within decentralized organizations and the influence of major stakeholders. The voting process seemed extremely dire, especially during the earlier stages of the voting process, where a16z 15 million plus votes constituted most of the votes casted.&nbsp;</p><p>Concerns about decentralization and venture capital influence over DeFi protocols like Uniswap have seemingly proved themselves to be well-founded and decreasingly farfetched. Many community members were frustrated by what they perceived as undue influence by a16z, arguing that it undermined the principles of decentralization. It was argued that a16z&#8217;s substantial voting power, derived from its significant holdings of UNI tokens, allowed it to disproportionately influence the outcome. This raised concerns about the centralization of power within Uniswap&#8217;s governance structure and the potential for conflicts of interest. The debate underscored the need for governance reforms to ensure a more balanced and inclusive decision-making process.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F035082ab-8ab0-4473-b1a9-e5a1264e1a10_650x552.jpeg" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="A16z votes against proposal to deploy Uniswap v3 on BNB Chain" class="sizing-normal" height="552" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F035082ab-8ab0-4473-b1a9-e5a1264e1a10_650x552.jpeg" title="A16z votes against proposal to deploy Uniswap v3 on BNB Chain" width="650" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>A significant factor in the final vote was a16z&#8217;s delegation of UNI tokens to third parties, many of whom supported the Wormhole proposal at the end, including but not limited to SBC. A representative for a16 mentioned that they have delegated over 40 million additional tokens to third parties. Theoretically, a16z could, in future votes, reclaim those UNI tokens, and the votes, for itself [11]. This delegation strategy, while common in decentralized governance, underscored the complexities and potential conflicts of interest within such systems. The broader crypto community closely monitored these events, raising questions about the influence of large token holders and the true decentralization of Uniswap&#8217;s governance.</p><p>The contentious vote brought to light broader issues regarding transparency and the effectiveness of decentralized governance. Critics pointed out that the influence of large stakeholders like a16z could sway decisions in ways that might not always align with the broader community&#8217;s interests. This sparked discussions about potential reforms to ensure more equitable decision-making processes in the future.</p><p>Proposals for governance reforms included introducing quadratic voting to reduce the influence of large stakeholders, implementing delegation mechanisms to empower smaller token holders, and enhancing transparency through detailed disclosures of voting power and interests. These reforms aimed to uphold the principles of decentralization while ensuring that governance decisions were fair and representative of the entire community. In the following section, we will delve into the various perspectives on the saga, providing an in-depth analysis of the community's suggestions and their potential impact on future governance reforms.</p><h2><strong>So&#8230;</strong></h2><p>The decision to deploy Uniswap V3 on the BNB Chain carries significant strategic implications for Uniswap and the broader DeFi landscape. Expanding to the BNB Chain aims to attract a broader user base, increase trading volumes, improve liquidity, and enhance the overall user experience. This move leverages Binance's extensive user base, lower transaction costs, and faster transaction speeds, positioning Uniswap to capture a larger market share.</p><p>Integrating with the BNB Chain aligns with the broader trend of multi-chain deployments among leading DeFi projects. This strategy underscores the growing importance of cross-chain interoperability, which is critical for maintaining and enhancing market competitiveness. By operating on multiple chains, Uniswap can better compete with other decentralized exchanges within the Binance ecosystem, such as PancakeSwap, and tap into the benefits of lower fees and faster transactions offered by other blockchains.</p><p>However, this expansion is not without risks. Security concerns associated with transitioning to a new blockchain are paramount. Ensuring the integrity and reliability of the bridging technology is crucial to maintaining user trust and platform security. Any security breach or failure in the bridging technology could severely damage Uniswap&#8217;s reputation and user trust. Therefore, thorough vetting and continuous monitoring of the chosen bridging technology are essential to safeguard against potential breaches.</p><p>Financial interests of stakeholders, particularly those with substantial investments in Uniswap, also play a critical role in this decision. The choice of bridge technology impacts the security, performance, and user experience of Uniswap&#8217;s cross-chain operations, ultimately affecting its market position and profitability. For major investors like a16z, this choice is not just technical but strategic, influencing the financial performance of their investments.</p><p>Community engagement is crucial for the success of this strategic move. Actively involving the community in decision-making processes through regular updates and forums can help gather valuable feedback and ensure alignment with user needs and preferences. Fostering a strong sense of community involvement and ownership can enhance user trust and support, leading to more informed and accepted decisions.</p><p>The decision to deploy Uniswap V3 on the BNB Chain introduced a critical debate over the choice of bridging technology, with significant implications for security, performance, and decentralization. Wormhole and LayerZero each presented unique advantages and challenges, making the selection a complex decision with strategic and financial ramifications.</p><p>Security was a primary concern in selecting a bridge. Wormhole, despite a significant breach in February 2022, has since implemented substantial security improvements. Its decentralized network of guardians and robust validation mechanisms have proven effective in securing cross-chain transactions. LayerZero, with its innovative ULN architecture, minimizes the attack surface and enhances security through a decentralized system of oracles and relayers. Both solutions offer strong security features, requiring careful evaluation to determine the best fit for Uniswap&#8217;s needs.</p><p>Performance and scalability were also critical factors. Uniswap&#8217;s expansion necessitates a bridge capable of handling high transaction volumes while maintaining fast transaction speeds. Wormhole&#8217;s established performance in managing substantial transaction volumes makes it a reliable choice. LayerZero&#8217;s ULN architecture, with its potential for improved scalability and efficiency, offers a promising alternative. Balancing proven reliability with the benefits of innovative technology is essential.</p><p>Decentralization and governance were key considerations. Wormhole&#8217;s decentralized guardian network supports trustlessness, though its 1/1 multisig setup requires ongoing scrutiny. LayerZero&#8217;s ULN architecture offers potential advantages in transaction efficiency and flexibility, but its 2/2 multisig setup and alleged security vulnerabilities need to be addressed to align with Uniswap&#8217;s decentralization goals.</p><p>To address these concerns, Uniswap should implement regular assessments by independent security experts to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities of its bridging solutions, ensuring the highest security standards. Exploring a hybrid model that leverages the strengths of both LayerZero and Wormhole could provide a more robust solution, enhancing security and decentralization. Developing a contingency plan to switch or integrate multiple bridging technologies based on performance and security assessments is also crucial. This plan ensures Uniswap remains adaptable and resilient in the face of evolving security threats, better protecting users and assets while fostering community trust.</p><p>Once again, engaging the community in selecting and evaluating bridging technologies is vital. Transparent discussions and voting can enhance community trust and ensure decisions align with the broader interests of Uniswap&#8217;s stakeholders. Effective governance mechanisms, including inclusive voting processes and detailed disclosures, can help maintain the integrity of decision-making and uphold decentralization principles.</p><h2><strong>A Way Forward</strong></h2><p>The decision to deploy Uniswap V3 on the BNB Chain highlighted the critical need for governance reforms within Uniswap. The substantial involvement of venture capital firms, particularly a16z, in the decision-making process exposed issues related to centralization, transparency, and community trust. While VCs provide essential funding, expertise, and resources that drive innovation and growth, their substantial influence raises concerns about the decentralized ethos of Uniswap and other DeFi projects.</p><p>Uniswap's governance process has demonstrated both the strengths and weaknesses of decentralized decision-making. Large stakeholders with substantial voting power can significantly influence outcomes, as seen with a16z&#8217;s holdings of UNI tokens and their strategic interests in LayerZero. This situation underscores the need for reforms to mitigate these risks and ensure equitable decision-making.</p><p>To address these concerns, several governance reform proposals have emerged. One key suggestion is implementing more inclusive voting processes, such as quadratic voting, which reduces the disproportionate influence of large token holders by making each additional vote cost exponentially more. This system can help ensure smaller token holders have a more significant voice in governance decisions. Uniswap could pilot this system on less critical proposals to test its impact and functionality, gather data, and address any practical issues. An education campaign to inform the community about quadratic voting, with guides, webinars, and interactive sessions, would support broader adoption.</p><p>Introducing a capped voting weight for individual entities or wallets is another critical reform. By capping the voting weight, Uniswap can prevent any single stakeholder from wielding excessive power, promoting a more decentralized decision-making process. This cap could be based on a percentage of the total voting power, ensuring fairness and preventing domination by a few large entities.</p><p>Improving delegation mechanisms can empower smaller token holders by enabling them to delegate their votes effectively. Establishing accountability measures for delegates, such as performance reviews and the ability for delegators to retract their votes if delegates do not act in their best interests, can ensure that delegates act responsibly. Introducing incentives for active participation, such as governance rewards and recognition for effective delegates, can further encourage smaller token holders to engage in governance.</p><p>Enhancing transparency and accountability is also crucial. Requiring major stakeholders, including VCs, to fully disclose their voting power and any potential conflicts of interest can provide greater transparency and ensure decisions are made in the community's best interest. Detailed disclosures should be publicly accessible, helping maintain trust within the governance process. Regular audits by independent third parties can verify disclosed information and voting behaviors, maintaining the governance process's integrity.</p><p>Finally, education campaigns and community feedback mechanisms are vital. Launching comprehensive education campaigns to inform the community about governance mechanisms, and establishing dedicated platforms for community feedback can ensure that governance processes remain aligned with the community&#8217;s interests and needs, especially for newcomers of the governance ecosystem. Regular community engagement to discuss governance issues and audit findings, can provide a platform for direct community input and ensure that governance processes are effective and aligned with decentralized principles.</p><h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>The decision to deploy Uniswap V3 on the BNB Chain marks a pivotal moment for Uniswap, highlighting both opportunities and challenges in expanding its DeFi presence. Strategically, this move allows Uniswap to tap into Binance's extensive user base, thereby increasing liquidity and trading volumes. However, it also underscores the necessity of addressing significant security concerns and ensuring the integrity of the bridging technology to maintain user trust and platform security.</p><p>The governance process surrounding this decision brought to light the substantial influence of venture capital firms like a16z, raising concerns about centralization and transparency. This has sparked a critical dialogue about the need for governance reforms to uphold decentralization, ensure equitable decision-making, and foster community trust. Proposed reforms include implementing quadratic voting to amplify the voices of smaller stakeholders, introducing capped voting weights to prevent domination by large entities, and improving delegation mechanisms to empower smaller token holders through accountability measures and incentives. Enhancing transparency is essential for maintaining trust within the governance process. Launching comprehensive education campaigns and establishing community feedback mechanisms will ensure that governance processes remain aligned with the community&#8217;s interests and needs.</p><p>Moving forward, Uniswap should continue exploring multi-chain deployments to enhance resilience and adaptability. By addressing the complexities and potential conflicts of interest within its governance framework, Uniswap can strengthen its position as a leading DeFi platform and build a more sustainable ecosystem. Continuous improvement and community involvement will help Uniswap uphold its decentralized ethos while navigating the evolving DeFi landscape.</p><p>The Uniswap BNB Chain deployment saga serves as a microcosm of broader challenges in DeFi, including decentralized governance, interoperability, and venture capital influence.

Until now, many applications, from rollups to coprocessors and other sharding approaches, have relied on in-house, custom-built tech stacks. This has resulted in liquidity fragmentation, reduced interoperability, and poor user experience.</p><p>To address these challenges, StarkWare and <a href="https://cartridge.gg/">Cartridge</a> are proud to introduce <strong>ZKThreads</strong>: a novel approach to scaling that balances security, composability, and interoperability for provable applications. This builds on the fractal scaling vision that StarkWare introduced in 2021 [1].</p><p>In this post, we will explain why ZKThreads are needed, cover their architectural design, and finally, illustrate how they open the door to new types of applications. With the addition of ZKThreads to Starknet&#8217;s existing suite of fractal-scaling technologies, Starknet expands its full-scope ZK operating system to fit any provable application [2].</p><h2><strong>Why ZKThreads?</strong></h2><p>History may not repeat itself, but it often rhymes. Before the introduction of the ERC-20 standard in November 2015, creating a new &#8220;token&#8221; or &#8220;coin&#8221; required constructing and maintaining an entire blockchain [3]. Even if you only wanted a memecoin, you&#8217;d have had to hard fork and bootstrap liquidity on your own blockchain, as was the case with Dogecoin. It&#8217;s no surprise that most tokens launched before the ERC-20 standard are now extinct.</p><p>Before ERC-20, tokens were highly integrated with the consensus protocol. Transfer mechanisms were not features that could be plucked out on their own. ERC-20, however, introduced a canonical standard to create and transact tokens on Ethereum itself without the need to hard fork and create an entirely new chain. Once projects began launching their own ERC-20s, liquidity became concentrated on Ethereum. This made it feasible to construct DEXs, lending protocols, stablecoins, and the entire DeFi ecosystem that exists today.</p><p>In the same vein, we face a comparable challenge in provable application development. Various applications, such as bridges, rollups, and ZK coprocessors, utilize ZK proofs, each with its own proof library, virtual machine (VM), and tech stack. The lack of interoperability between these stacks is cumbersome and often results in a less-than-ideal user experience.</p><p>Take, for instance, the case of the ZK coprocessor. In the simplest sense, a ZK coprocessor relies on a &#8220;compute offchain, verify onchain&#8221; model, where the &#8220;compute&#8221; ranges from specific tasks (such as computations over historical data) to Turing-complete, general-purpose computation [3]. The &#8220;verification&#8221; in this model refers to posting a ZK proof onto a settlement layer that attests to the validity of execution results. This allows developers to run computationally intensive programs offchain and prove their validity onchain. Still, the ZK coprocessor&#8217;s design poses several challenges:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Security</strong>: ZK coprocessors can guarantee proof of correctness, but they can&#8217;t guarantee liveness. In other words, they can&#8217;t guarantee that they will actually provide the proofs.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Composability</strong>: Every tech stack has its own technical standard, whether through custom ZK libraries or circuits. This results in a lack of composability between these different layers.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Interoperability:</strong> Because of (1) and (2), applications running on ZK coprocessors are siloed from one another, leading to fragmented liquidity and a lack of interoperability.</p></li></ul><p>Instead, we need a common interface&#8212;just like ERC-20&#8212;to standardize the development of provable applications and open the door to applications that require interoperability, pooled liquidity, and other shared resources.</p><p><strong>Enter ZKThreads.</strong></p><p>Leveraging Starknet&#8217;s position as a leading validity rollup and Cairo&#8217;s natural advantage as an easily provable language, ZKThreads standardize the development of provable applications and provides the following guarantees:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Security:</strong> ZKThreads allow for executing directly on Starknet when needed, ensuring liveness at every step and a leaner design for dApps.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Composability:</strong> Through introducing the ZKThread standard, developers are provided with a standard, composable toolkit to develop a wide variety of provable applications, including native bridging, common DA layers, and security mechanisms.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Interoperability:</strong> All applications using the ZKThread standard will natively interoperate with each other, minimizing fragmentation and opening up numerous new use cases.</p></li></ul><h2><strong>How do ZKThreads work?</strong></h2><p>The overall goal of the ZKThreads architecture is to allow provable applications to balance performance, composability, and interoperability. Architecturally, it is composed of:</p><ul><li><p><strong>The ZKThread</strong> &#8211; This includes a batcher, a prover, and contracts.</p></li><li><p><strong>The ZKThread Verifier</strong> &#8211; A contract on Starknet that verifies state changes in each ZKThread</p></li></ul><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8f6a4ac4-dade-42a7-aa19-46d691355fcb_1024x768.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="768" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8f6a4ac4-dade-42a7-aa19-46d691355fcb_1024x768.png" title="" width="1024" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>The operational logic of the ZKThread is as follows:</p><ul><li><p>Application logic is deployed in the thread&#8217;s app contracts, which produce transactions and state changes in the dApp ZKThread.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Transactions in the ZKThread become batched in a sub-block.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>The prover creates a STARK proof of the sub-block state changes and sends it to the L2 sequencer.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>The ZKThread Verifier verifies the proof of the state changes against the canonical record it holds of the dApp.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>The ZKThread Verifier either accepts or rejects the state changes. If accepted, the canonical record is updated. If rejected, it cancels the ZKThread transaction on the L2.</p></li></ul><p>The ZKThread Verifier&#8217;s primary goal is to attest to the validity of the state-change proof emitted by a ZKThread. It does this by recording the canonical state of each dApp and the OS version, and then checking the list of state changes against the canonical state. If everything adds up, the ZKThread transaction is accepted and the canonical state is updated. If not, the transaction is rejected.</p><p>By remaining in the canonical state, ZKThreads enable much easier interoperability between the different threads and contrasts with L3 design, which holds a completely different state.</p><h2><strong>What ZKThreads bring to the table</strong></h2><p>Processes and threads are not only different components in the world of traditional operating systems but also in the world of blockchain. L2 and L3 appchains are the Starknet versions of processes, while ZKThreads are comparable to their namesake in operating systems. Here&#8217;s how ZKThreads differs from L2 and L3 appchains:</p><ul><li><p><strong>L2 and L3 appchains</strong> run isolated processes&#8212;each with its separate resources, designs, and states. Although it is possible to use shared data availability frameworks and other mechanisms to achieve forms of interoperability, these are far from ideal.</p></li><li><p><strong>ZKThreads</strong> are the blockchain version of threads in the world of operating systems. Their processes operate on shared system resources and are natively interfaced through the dApps canonical state. ZKThreads are designed from the very start to be interoperable, introducing a simple yet elegant design that implements a new canonical framework for ZK coprocessing.</p></li></ul><p>By combining L2 and L3 appchains and ZKThreads into its scalability buffet, Starknet creates an operating system that balances performance, composability, and interoperability. Some of the benefits of ZKThreads are:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Improved UX:</strong> Due to the interoperability enabled by ZKThreads, users of apps built as ZKThreads can move from app to app without switching networks and other infrastructure.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Lower costs:</strong> Like L3s, ZKThreads enable additional scaling on Starknet by adding another layer of proof compression before settlement. That means even lower costs than on the public L2.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>No fees on the Thread:</strong> Apps operating as a ZKThread update the base layer at regular intervals in bulk, meaning users won&#8217;t need to pay fees on their individual transactions within the thread. Fees will only be paid when settling on the base layer.</p></li></ul><h2><strong>ZKThreads: Use cases</strong></h2><p>Just as the ERC-20 standard paved the way for various use cases in crypto we see today, ZKThreads open the door to provable applications that require an additional level of interoperability that can&#8217;t exist under an L3 model. They expand the panel of scaling solutions available within Starknet. Consider the following:</p><p><strong>L2 DEXes</strong></p><p>ZKThreads open the door to decentralized exchanges (DEXes) on Starknet. Think, for example, of dYdX, powered by StarkEx. Operating such a platform directly on Starknet today would be unfeasible because users would have to pay fees on every single trade. With ZKThreads, users only have to pay fees when they cash out.</p><p><strong>Session-based Games</strong></p><p>ZKThreads offer the same solution for session-based games, such as poker and chess. Rather than having to pay a fee on every move, players only pay fees once the game is over and the result is submitted to public Starknet from the thread. This opens up the fully onchain game design space to a wider variety of game genres.</p><p><strong>ZK-secured middleware and shared liquidity infrastructure</strong></p><p>With ZKThreads, Oracles, bridges, and other forms of middleware do not need to bootstrap a validator set from scratch, nor do they need to rely on forms of restaking that may pose centralization risks to the underlying chain. Instead, they could directly build functionality as a ZKThread, and let the ZK proofs generated in the ZKThread framework guarantee security and interoperability. This is especially true in the case of liquidity infrastructure, much of which can be shared between different applications.</p><p>Take, for example, Uniswap Hooks, the plugins available to customize how pools, swaps, fees, and LP positions interact on Uniswap [5]. The boilerplate code for Uniswap Hooks is the same as regular Uniswap, but certain aspects of the protocol can be customized to fit specific needs. In the ZKThread design, most of the program could be hosted as a ZKThread, while the stored canonical version could offer a customizable API with hooks that other ZKThreads and applications can use.</p><p><strong>Onchain AI, social networking, and other common utilities</strong></p><p>Onchain AI systems, social graphs (the databases that track user touch points across platforms), and other libraries that can be shared across various applications could all benefit from the vast library of common digital resources mentioned above. ZKThreads offer the computational flexibility and resources to host an onchain AI agent or model. The canonical state of this model can then be mirrored in the ZKThread Manager for use in various applications, spanning from gaming to social networking to productivity tools.</p><h2><strong>Marching toward verifiable applications</strong></h2><p>Of course, the above list of potentially new dApps is not exhaustive of all the potential types of applications that can be built using ZKThreads. Still, they provide insight into what ZKThreads enable: a design that merges security, composability, and interoperability. Just like ERC-20s, the ZKThreads standard marks a pivotal point in the maturation of blockchain. With the addition of ZKThreads to Starknet&#8217;s suite of other industry-leading technologies, Starknet will expand its full-scope ZK operating system that aims to create a thriving ecosystem of verifiable applications, where all arbitrary computation can be proven correct. Trustlessness has long been a promise of the blockchain space. Validity proofs embody this pursuit of truthfulness as one of the best examples of how the industry marks a paradigm shift in computing history. And so we march onward toward a world of verifiable applications.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Thanks for reading the Stanford Blockchain Review!

Thoughtfully crafted incentive mechanisms and cryptographic techniques facilitate the flow of value among all participants within an open ecosystem. However, all participants are not equal and sophisticated actors continue to extract value from unsophisticated end users. Significant improvements have been made to enhance the user experience and democratize the MEV landscape but Ethereum continues to be a dark forest, offering sub-optimal user experience due to the extractive techniques of different monsters.&nbsp;</p><p>&#8205;We believe that preconfirmations are the next natural step in the evolution of blockchain design space intended to level the playing field for all participants and improve the user experience. We contend that preconfirmations will be essential in bridging the gap between execution experience between web2 applications and dapps that exists today. In this article, we begin by defining preconfirmations. Next we describe the various approaches being proposed and designed, their respective tradeoffs, and the impact on the future of execution in web3.&nbsp;</p><h3>&#8205;<strong>Preconfirmations</strong></h3><p>In everyday life, people are so familiar with preconfirmations that they hardly notice it. For example, when making an online payment or placing a BUY order on a platform like Robinhood, users expect their request to be fulfilled once they see a confirmation on their screen. The entity processing the order might face numerous challenges to complete the request, but users remain unaware of these complexities.</p><p>&#8205;In blockchain transactions, preconfirmation serves as a reliable and timely promise from a <strong>provider</strong> (someone who executes such as a validator or block builder) to a<strong> bidder </strong>(the entity needing transaction execution). This promise, offered in exchange for an economic incentive, ensures better transaction execution. This promise could mean different things depending on whether it is a promise of transaction inclusion, execution or success. Depending on who is responsible for block building, preconfirmations can be provided to end users or intermediaries like searchers, solvers, bots, AA bundlers, or even rollup sequencers.

Validators auction off the right to build a block to the builder who bids the highest in an auction. Users, trading bots and searchers (special users who run algorithms to construct profitable transactions) submit their transactions via RPC nodes to mempool or directly to builders. Builders construct the most profitable block possible by aggregating transactions from the public mempool and private orderflow and then bid in an open auction to win the right to build the block. The auction is facilitated by relays who ensure that the highest bidding block wins and the validator cannot steal the MEV from the builder and keep all the MEV rewards for themselves.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95f5a4be-b548-4ed5-873d-ece07aa23853_1074x246.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="246" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95f5a4be-b548-4ed5-873d-ece07aa23853_1074x246.png" width="1074" /><div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Source: Decentralization of Ethereum&#8217;s Builder Market (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.01329)</figcaption></figure></div><h4><strong>Challenges</strong></h4><p>MEV-Boost has enabled the separation of the proposer and builder role but a number of challenges still persist:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Value extraction from end users: </strong>In order to win the auction, builders are heavily incentivized to extract the maximum value from the block. This usually comes at a cost to the end user who ends up with the most value extracted from their transactions. Builders do need to maintain a balance here because they are competing with each other for private orderflow and excess execution tax could drive away their orderflow. However, blocks built by builders do result in more value being extracted from the end user.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Transaction execution risk: </strong>Searchers and end users cannot guarantee their transaction's inclusion in the current block, nor can they specify transaction ordering or target block number. Solvers on intent-centric platforms like UniswapX also face execution uncertainty. To remain competitive, solvers either vertically integrate by running their own builder or secure exclusive deals with builders to ensure their transactions are prioritized, creating an entry barrier for new solvers.</p></li><li><p><strong>Block builder concentration: </strong>The block builder market is highly concentrated, with the top three builders creating over 90% of the blocks. A key reason for this concentration is access to private order flow. To avoid malicious builders, who might unbundle transactions and capture MEV profits, searchers only share their order flow with reputable builders. This creates a chicken-and-egg problem: builders need private order flow to gain market share, but searchers only trust builders who already have a significant market share. Another way to access private order flow could be through having an affiliated HFT trading arm.</p></li><li><p><strong>Validator timing games: </strong>In order to maximize the MEV in the current implementation, validators engage in &#8220;timing games&#8221;, a strategy where block proposers intentionally delay publication of their block for as long as possible to maximize MEV capture [2].</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Lower censorship resistance</strong>: Since most proposing validators outsource block building to specialized entities (or risk losing the MEV), they do not have any say in what transactions to include. Proposers do not retain any authority by which transactions can be forcibly included.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Lack of trustless coordination across intermediaries: </strong>The relationship between searchers/channels and builders is based on trust and hence, most searchers are unwilling to share their orderflow with new or small builders. The validators connecting with censoring relays need to trust that the relays are verifying and censoring only OFAC transactions [3]. Builders also trust relays to not steal their MEV and propagate data in a timely manner.</p></li></ul><p>&#8205;In order to overcome these challenges, we need a<strong> coordination mechanism </strong>amongst all the intermediaries (users, bots, searchers, builders, relays and validators) to enable <strong>trustless and reliable communication in a timely manner</strong>. Preconfirmations could solve a number of above mentioned challenges by serving as a coordination mechanism, and several approaches have been proposed to implement it. For transactions on L1, we look at Inclusion Lists, Execution Tickets and mev-commit by Primev.</p><h3>&#8205;<strong>Inclusion Lists (IL)</strong></h3><p>ILs allow proposing validators to force include certain transactions in the current or subsequent block. The <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7547">idea was proposed</a> by Mike, Vitalik, Francesco, Terence, Potuz, Manav in late 2023. The motivation behind IL is to address the limitations faced by validators in absence of a forced inclusion mechanism. Without IL, validators must either entirely outsource block building or forgo MEV by building the block locally. IL enables proposing validators to outsource block building while still ensuring the inclusion of specific transactions.</p><p>&#8205;<strong>Design of Inclusion Lists</strong></p><p>The proposer for slot N broadcasts a signed block and an inclusion list for slot N+1. The transactions in the IL will be included in slot N or slot N+1, otherwise the N+1 block will be invalid. Slot N validators only consider the block for validation if there is at least one inclusion list for that slot. For slot N+1, the proposer incorporates a signed summary from slot N proposer and the payload is considered valid if it satisfies the inclusion list summary, and the consensus conditions are met with a proposer signature of the previous block.&nbsp;</p><h4>&#8205;<strong>Implications</strong></h4><ul><li><p>ILs are likely to improve censorship resistance (CR) to a certain degree by allowing validating proposers to have a say in the block building process</p></li><li><p>While CR is improved to a certain extent, validators are likely to continue outsourcing their block building to builders to maximize their revenue. They could decide to include transactions in the presence of an incentive structure where they could sell inclusion guarantees to users or searchers. MEV actors are likely to engage in off-chain deals in the absence of a defined mechanism for validators to give preconfirmations to users and searchers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Depending on the implementation details, the legal implications remain uncertain. The proposer in Slot A could push all controversial transactions (OFAC sanctioned transactions) to Slot B. The proposer in Slot B might include only the bare minimum transactions required for block validity, further pushing the remaining controversial transactions to Slot C. Determining who is responsible for the included transactions and the legal implications of this process is challenging at this stage.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>IL are likely to include additional complexity at the protocol level</p></li></ul><p>&#8205;The <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7547">proposal</a> is currently in the draft stage. IL also forms the basis of execution tickets and the original based preconfirmation architecture proposed by Justin Drake which we discuss later in this article.</p><h3>&#8205;<strong>Execution Tickets (ET)</strong></h3><p>ET was originally introduced as Attester-Proposer Separation (APS) by Justin Drake, and later published in an <a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/execution-tickets/17944">ethresearch article</a> by Mike Neuder. Currently, validators are responsible for two primary tasks:</p><ul><li><p>Proposing the beacon block during the beacon round</p></li><li><p>Build the execution payload of the block during the execution round. This is usually outsourced to block builders using mev-boost</p></li></ul><p>Validators are selected randomly for both tasks through a single lottery based on the amount of staked ETH. However, the task of building execution payloads can exert centralizing pressure on validators, as they may vertically integrate with builders and leverage low-latency connections. ET is being proposed as a solution to bifurcate these two responsibilities, protecting validators from centralizing forces and enabling more solo validators to participate as beacon block validators, thereby boosting decentralization.</p><p>&#8205;<strong>Design of Execution Tickets</strong></p><p>The existing PoS lottery will be used to select validators randomly to propose beacon blocks. However, a separate primary lottery market will be created to allow entities to purchase ETs. The ticket owner will have the permission to propose the execution block for the slot (which they can do themselves or outsource via mev-boost). An execution block proposer will be selected at random from all the ET holders [4].&nbsp;</p><p><strong>&#8205;Implications</strong></p><ul><li><p>ETs promote decentralization amongst beacon block validators because MEV part of the rewards are separated which previously benefited big staking pools more than smaller ones. However, ETs are likely to introduce more centralization among ET holders, potentially leading to liveness risks. Pricing ETs is challenging and currently only feasible for block builders. As a result, the existing centralization of block builders could extend to the ET markets [5].</p></li><li><p>ETs enable more MEV to be captured by the protocol. Revenue from ticket sales is intended to be burned, applying deflationary pressure on ETH&#8217;s supply, increasing ETH&#8217;s value, and thereby enhancing network security, assuming no new vectors of the attacks are introduced.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Big validator entities might not view ETs favorably because by they will no longer have an edge over smaller validators and is likely to impact their revenue</p></li><li><p>If multi-block MEV is prevalent (if a ticket holder wins multiple blocks in a row), the advantage gained from controlling successive blocks could lead to significant centralization. Controlling multiple consecutive blocks can yield disproportionately higher rewards than the sum of the individual blocks&#8217; values. Impact of multiblock MEV requires more research to better quantify its impact.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>ETs are still at an early stage and require a lot of research from an implementation POV before being actually adopted by Ethereum. The pricing mechanism must be designed thoughtfully to capture as much value as possible for the protocol while still being attractive and viable for proposers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>&#8205;IL and ET improve censorship resistance and separate the roles of proposing beacon blocks and building execution payloads. However, they fall short of enabling the entire MEV supply chain to coordinate effectively. They also do not sufficiently reduce the likelihood of off-chain deals and vertical integration. Mev-commit could address some of these issues.</p><h3>&#8205;<strong>Mev-commit by Primev</strong></h3><p>Mev-commit is a P2P network designed to enable all MEV intermediaries to coordinate efficiently and trustlessly. It features a fast chain, a fork of geth, where commitments about the execution of Ethereum transactions can be recorded along with the logic to reward/slash providers. It allows bidders (such as Searchers, Solvers, Telegram Bots, AA Bundlers, Wallets, Transaction aggregators and end users) to specify their preference for transaction execution and get a commitment from execution providers (such as block builders, validators). These preferences could be something like:</p><ul><li><p>Ensure that txn A is included in block number X</p></li><li><p>Precise blockspace entry (top 10% of block or bottom of block)</p></li><li><p>Include txn A only if txn B has been executed</p></li><li><p>Include txn B after txn A only</p></li><li><p>The gas price of the txn should be lower than X</p></li><li><p>Multi block commitments (execute 3 txs in the next 3 blocks, 1 each block)</p></li><li><p>Commitment from sequencers of two different rollups for a pair of cross-chain txn to go through simultaneously</p></li></ul><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8984ecaa-42d4-49ae-8ee7-b20564ed2daf_1056x256.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="256" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8984ecaa-42d4-49ae-8ee7-b20564ed2daf_1056x256.png" width="1056" /><div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Source: Primev Documentation</figcaption></figure></div><p><strong>Design of mev-commit</strong></p><p>The process overall can be summarized in the following steps:</p><ul><li><p>Bidders submit their bid to the mev-commit network (bidders have pseudonymous identity for privacy protection) in an encrypted mempool</p></li><li><p>Bids are received and evaluated by providers, who decide if they want to issue a cryptographic commitment against the bid or not</p></li><li><p>The commitment provided is recorded on the mev-commit chain</p></li><li><p>Bids/commitments written to mev-commit chain get revealed at time of execution and an oracle will check the target block (once it is confirmed) to see if the commitment is satisfied by the committing actor</p></li><li><p>If yes, the provider is awarded with the bid amount and if not, the provider is slashed</p></li><li><p>The provider is slashed or rewarded only if that provider participated in the block&#8217;s confirmation.

Some searchers will still be selective with their order flow but mev-commit will make it more democratized. Searchers can develop their own deals with custom logic on the mev-commit chain and receive real time commitments.</p></li></ul><p>&#8205;<strong>New use cases</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Multi-transaction flash loans</strong>: Flash Loans currently cannot span across multiple transactions and the loan needs to be paid off in the same transaction as currently there is no way to enforce loan payback. Builders on mev-commit can allow multi-transaction flash loans by ensuring that the built block is sound in terms of the loan being paid back, otherwise their stake can be slashed.</p></li><li><p><strong>Builder pooled decentralized flashloan system</strong>: Multiple builders and sponsors can pool funds (maybe re-staked assets) supplemented by protocol revenue. This pool of funds can be used for providing flashloan monitored by protocol rules rather than relying only on liquidity from pools of lending protocols like Aave.</p></li><li><p><strong>Commitment games: </strong>The mev-commit chain could be used to deploy dapps offering execution related commitment games where ethereum transactions can be committed to faster than ethereum blocks&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>&#8205;<strong>Risks</strong></p><ul><li><p>Validator staking/opt-in contracts on mainnet introduce smart contract risk. This risk can be mitigated through audits and rigorous testing.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Since mev-commit introduces its own chain and oracle solution, validators must trust the correctness of execution on the mev-commit chain and slashing transactions managed by oracle service. Decentralization of the chain and oracle will be important to mitigate this risk.</p></li><li><p>Validators will be required to only propose blocks from a mev-commit opted-in relay. As more and more relays opt-in, this risk will decrease as validator's relay picks will not be disrupted.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>&#8205;The Primev team has been building mev-commit for two years now and is currently live on testnet with many validators and builders testing it for mainnet readiness.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ab0e2c9-869f-4802-949f-aab988820b32_938x526.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="526" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ab0e2c9-869f-4802-949f-aab988820b32_938x526.png" width="938" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><h2><strong>Preconfirmations for transactions on L2</strong></h2><h3><strong>The current state of rollups</strong></h3><p>Most rollups handle sequencing and execution, while relying on Ethereum L1 for data availability and settlement. Currently, rollups use centralized sequencers to accept and sequence transactions. A validator/prover then generates the final state based on these sequenced transactions and posts it on the L1 bridge contract.</p><p>&#8205;Centralized sequencers can provide users with soft commitments about transaction inclusion before L1 verification. Users cannot enforce these soft commitments (via programmatic slashing or arbitration) but they can trust the sequencer&#8217;s commitments since they are responsible for selecting and sequencing. This soft commitment can be termed as preconfirmation. However, if the validator/prover fails to post the final state on L1, as <a href="https://twitter.com/conduitxyz/status/1790065376975552549">seen</a> with Degena and Proof of Play&#8217;s Apex, this trust is compromised. Centralized sequencers offer preconfirmations but also pose risks of censorship, single points of failure and MEV extraction. Decentralizing sequencers is challenging, especially in maintaining preconfirmations for users.</p><p>&#8205;<strong>Based rollups&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In order to leverage the existing L1 MEV supply chain to build and propose L2 blocks, Justin Drake formally proposed <a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/based-rollups-superpowers-from-l1-sequencing/15016">based rollups</a> in March 2023. The idea was first introduced as &#8220;Total Anarchy&#8221; by Vitalik in the article &#8220;<a href="https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html">An Incomplete Guide to Rollups</a>&#8221; in 2021 where total anarchy meant &#8203;&#8203;that anyone could submit a batch at any time. Justin Drake followed up his proposal with the concept of <a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/based-preconfirmations/17353">based preconfirmations</a> in November 2023 for preconfirmations in the absence of centralized sequencers.&nbsp;</p><p>&#8205;<strong>Design of based rollup</strong></p><p>As defined by Justin Drake, &#8220;<em>A rollup is said to be based, or L1-sequenced, when its sequencing is driven by the base L1. More concretely, a based rollup is one where the next L1 proposer may, in collaboration with L1 searchers and builders, permissionlessly include the next rollup block as part of the next L1 block.&#8221; </em>[5]</p><p>&#8205;Basically, L1 builder or L1 searcher can play the role of L2 block builder by picking the transactions from L2 mempool, building the L2 block and including it in the L1 bundle. Since most of the MEV flows to the L1 validators, L1 proposers are incentivized to include rollup blocks on the L1.</p><p>&#8205;<strong>Implications</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Decentralization and Liveness: </strong>Based rollups inherit decentralization and liveness from L1 relying on the battle tested infrastructure of Ethereum. They are not subject to short-term sequencer censorship during the timeout period and the possibility of mass exit triggered by a sequencer liveness failure is eliminated.</p></li><li><p><strong>Simplicity: </strong>Based sequencing is simple because it requires no sequencer signature verification, no escape hatch, and no external PoS consensus.</p></li><li><p><strong>MEV Capture: </strong>Based sequencing allows MEV to be captured by L1 and thus strengthens the L1 economic security. However, this poses a dilemma for rollups, as they must sacrifice MEV for the sake of security, decentralization, simplicity, and alignment with L1. Rollups face a trade-off between capturing MEV value and potentially gaining more market share by prioritizing these benefits.</p></li><li><p><strong>Lack of fast preconfirmations: </strong>Leveraging L1 for sequencing makes it difficult to provide fast preconfirmations using the existing protocol design.</p></li><li><p><strong>Public mempool: </strong>Based sequencing reintroduces a public mempool to L2s which allows for sandwich attacks and frontrunning, which does not exist in other rollups.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>&#8205;Taiko is the first based rollups to launch mainnet and a few others like Aztec are considering becoming a based rollup. You may read details about Taiko&#8217;s based rollup design <a href="https://taiko.mirror.xyz/7dfMydX1FqEx9_sOvhRt3V8hJksKSIWjzhCVu7FyMZU">here</a>. We will continue to focus more on based preconfirmation.&nbsp;</p><h3>&#8205;<strong>Based preconfirmations</strong></h3><p>Based preconfirmations allow rollups to leverage L1 sequencing without sacrificing the benefits of preconfirmation offered by centralized sequencers. To enable effective based preconfirmations, following requirements must be met:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Provider forced inclusions</strong>: The provider should be in a position to include transactions for which preconfirmation has been given. The approach depends on who the provider is.</p><ul><li><p>If proposing validators offer preconfirmation, they need a mechanism to include transactions in the block. This can be done by building the block themselves rather than outsourcing it through mev-boost. Alternatively, they need a coordination mechanism with builders to ensure accountability. This can be achieved through approaches like IL or ET, which require protocol-level changes, or through crList, which necessitates changes to mev-boost.</p></li><li><p>If block builders provide preconfirmation, they can enforce execution if they win the bid in the mev-boost auction. Builders can guarantee execution, but they cannot be certain of winning the bid. If bidders get preconfirmation from enough builders, they can be fairly certain that their condition will be fulfilled. Currently, bidders receiving preconfirmation from the top three builders have more than 90% probability of execution.</p></li><li><p>Any other entity which joins as a provider to offer based preconfirmations as long as they validator participation</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Slashing</strong>: To ensure that provider adheres to the conditions promised as preconfirmation to the bidder&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Off-chain mechanism</strong> to allow users to acquire preconfirmation. These commitments must be visible and understandable to others to ensure credibility.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>&#8205;Some of the notable proposals are:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Justin Drake&#8217;s proposal for based preconfirmation: </strong>Justin&#8217;s <a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/based-preconfirmations/17353">original proposal</a> has undergone changes based on the community feedback. The proposed design allows rollups to use Ethereum L1 for shared sequencing and preconfirmations without requiring a hard fork. According to the <a href="https://notes.ethereum.org/WLuNFaliQiqw7Zhd-7AnmQ">latest proposal</a>, instead of relying on IL, ET will be used. With ETs every rational L1 execution proposer will opt to become a sequencer so that the even the L1 EVM can enjoy preconfirmations. It also requires changes to mev-boost, so that the sequencer can communicate constraints (e.g. top-of-block or top-of-blob constraints) to relays and builders.</p></li><li><p><strong>Nethermind Research and Flashbots proposal</strong>: It builds upon Justin Drake&#8217;s design to allow based rollups to accrue some MEV to rollups itself. It proposes an auction mechanism which charges some amount for the right to be a preconfirmer for a based rollup. This amount is then paid back to rollup ensuring the value generated by the rollup is first sent to the rollup. Just like Justin Drakes&#8217; proposal, this approach also needs to figure out the method by which proposing validators will force inclusion of transactions on L1. They have also <a href="https://app.charmverse.io/taiko/page-9226869973335512">proposed</a> a possible implementation for Taiko.</p></li><li><p><strong>Mev-commit by Primev: </strong>mev-commit by Primev, currently on testnet, is built to support coordination amongst all MEV intermediaries on L1. Primev could stand up a preconfirmation provider on mev-commit for any based rollup as reflected in their <a href="https://app.charmverse.io/taiko/l1-preconfirmations-using-mev-commit-026602763205510582">proposal</a> to Taiko. Since builders can directly provide preconfirmation, there is no need for a new force inclusion method as required by all other solutions. Users could get preconfirmation from multiple builders to increase the chances of their condition being met.</p></li><li><p><strong>BFT preconfirmations by Espresso: </strong>Is offered by the Espresso decentralized sequencer. Espresso intends the sequencer to engage the participation of Ethereum validators through restaking contracts for shared security with the Ethereum L1. The participating validators come to consensus on the state of rollup using HotShot consensus. HotShot&#8217;s low latency can be used to offer preconfirmation. Users can trust a rollup server that has executed the transaction before a proof is generated.</p></li><li><p><strong>Proposer-promised (&#8220;PP&#8221;) preconfirmations by Espresso: </strong>Unlike BFT preconfirmations that require agreement among the entire validator set, PP preconfirmations only require approval from individual validators. Each rollup is also empowered to customize the PP preconfirmation ordering and slashing conditions to meet their individual needs. Espresso gives preconfirmations for the transactions in their rollups, but needs to secure L1 confirmation as well which can be achieved via IL, ET or mev-commit.</p></li></ul><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e29f5e4-dda9-404e-8c74-293463b36441_1600x1116.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="1016" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e29f5e4-dda9-404e-8c74-293463b36441_1600x1116.png" width="1456" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Preconfirmation is an inevitable aspect within the broader field of blockspace monetization and technological improvements in transaction execution. While <a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/introducing-onebalance/19557">introducing OneBalance</a>, Stephane Gosselin also talked about the importance of preconfirmation in helping solvers manage their settlement risk. Conversations with builders, searchers, solvers, and other ecosystem participants indicate that preconfirmations are likely to gain momentum in the near future.&nbsp;</p><p>&#8205;Before widespread adoption, it is essential to conduct thorough research, auditing, and testing. Ensuring efficient price discovery of commitments and preventing centralization is vital. As Lin Oshitani highlighted, naive implementations of based preconfirmations can lead to negative externalities [7]. We are excited to see many validators already participating in the mev-commit testnet, which helps them better understand the economic impacts, benefits, and risks associated with preconfirmations.</p><p>&#8205;Extensive research is already underway, spearheaded by the Ethereum Foundation and the broader community. Numerous teams and researchers have published their findings and proposals on this topic. Drew Van der Werff <a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/based-proposer-commitments-ethereum-s-marketplace-for-proposer-commitments/19517">proposed</a> Commitment Boost, an idea to standardize the way proposers register, send and receive commitments. mteam from Spire Labs <a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/credibly-neutral-preconfirmation-collateral-the-preconfirmation-registry/19634">introduced</a> Preconfirmation registry, a system for proposers (large operators as well as solo-stakers) to post collateral in ETH [. Chainbound recently announced Bolt, a protocol that allows Ethereum proposers to offer commitments about their block contents. Primev <a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/blob-preconfirmations-with-inclusion-lists-to-mitigate-blob-contention-and-censorship/19150">proposed</a> a solution for blob preconfirmation using mev-commit and IL. As the number of L2s increase and the blob market becomes saturated, the solution will allow L2 sequencers to gain certainty about blob inclusion and mitigate latency issues of blocks with many blobs in the future.<br /><br />We believe that out-of-protocol implementations will act as a catalyst for innovation and iteration, speeding up time to market similar to Flashbots' mev-boost. These implementations will help researchers refine designs and gather valuable feedback from all entities without overloading the L1.Vitalik recently mentioned in his blog, &#8220;<em>Layer 1 could incorporate a "fast pre-confirmation" and "slow final confirmation" system. It could incorporate different shards with different levels of security. However, this would add a lot of complexity to the protocol. Furthermore, doing it all on layer 1 would risk overloading the consensus, because a lot of the higher-scale or faster-throughput approaches have higher centralization risks or require stronger forms of "governance", and if done at L1, the effects of those stronger demands would spill over to the rest of the protocol.&#8221; </em>[8]</p><p>Each thing we enshrine in Ethereum, like SSF, ePBS etc, adds an extra round of attestations and could increase block times to 20-30 seconds. In such a scenario, preconfirmations become infinitely more valuable because it allows Ethereum to innovate without degrading UX.</p><p>&#8205;The improved user experience and new use cases enabled by preconfirmations will drive demand. On the supply side, additional revenue from bidders, enhanced censorship resistance, and a robust blockspace market will be key factors. Preconfirmations stand out as one of the most promising innovations to address the inherent limitations of the Ethereum transaction supply chain. We are extremely excited about this emerging space and are thrilled to see the support from the Ethereum Foundation and the broader community. We believe that preconfirmations will play a crucial role in elevating the Ethereum transaction execution experience to be on par with rollups and empowering users to survive the dark forest of MEV while fostering sustainable blockspace market.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Thanks for reading the Stanford Blockchain Review!

Over time, the evolution of web3 has expanded their use cases, underscoring the potential of blockchain technology to create an internet where creators thrive and users maintain control over their data.</p><p>A key piece in enabling an infrastructure empowering end-users while maintaining decentralization is ensuring that data is stored in a resilient, censorship-resistant database. While convenient and familiar, centralized databases fail to provide the necessary security guarantees and require permission from the database owner, restricting global reach.&nbsp;</p><p>Distributed data storage systems satisfy the need for fault-tolerant, highly resilient storage by building on a network of nodes that stores, manages, and shares data. Eliminating the need for a central authority in addition to distributing data in a p2p fashion enhances security and transparency. Typically built on blockchain or similar tech, distributed storage systems tend to replicate data for redundancy and availability.&nbsp;</p><p>While distributed storage systems offer benefits such as security, data resilience, and potentially increased cost-effectiveness by relying on unused storage capacity, they face challenges regarding regulations and interoperability.&nbsp;</p><p>For a truly open and accessible web, distributed storage is indispensable. A crucial aspect of any storage system, then, is the question of how data is provably stored and maintained. The more important question for users is, how is data provably stored and maintained? This is addressed through data proofs.</p><p>In general, we differentiate between two types of proofs:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p><strong>Deterministic Proofs:</strong> proofs that allow data holders to create a proof for a specific piece of data which demonstrates its creation, and matches the hash of the data. With this type of proof, only the hash generated using the data as input is publicly available.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Probabilistic Proofs: </strong>rely on probabilities to demonstrate a high likelihood that the underlying data is available. It's proof that rationally demonstrates a degree of certainty for a specific assumption in regard to data that has been published and is available for retrieval if necessary.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p></li></ul><p>The rest of this article will discuss three different design choices for proving data storage and integrity in different systems. The first is Tagion, a DLT with a focus on high-volume and scalable data. Then, we will discuss how the decentralized storage network Filecoin ensures data is stored at scale. Finally, this article will look at Celestia, a blockchain solely focused on storing and making blockchain data available.</p><h2><strong>Tagion </strong></h2><h3><strong>Architecture</strong></h3><p>Tagion is a decentralized network for high-volume transactions on a mission to build a unique monetary system based on technology and democratic governance. The project relies on innovative database architecture and cryptography to reach a massive scale. It's not a blockchain but a distributed ledger that optimizes storage using a DART database. Tagion's proving mechanism is an example of a deterministic proof .&nbsp;</p><p>The DART database, at its core, functions as a distributed hash table where data is stored according to hash-key pairs. This structure organically grows more branches as more information is stored, supporting up to 256 combined archives and subbranches per branch [1].&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9192702b-a9e4-46df-a010-32d53450f66a_574x385.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="385" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9192702b-a9e4-46df-a010-32d53450f66a_574x385.png" width="574" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Tagion WP <a href="https://www.tagion.org/resources/tagion-whitepaper.pdf">https://www.tagion.org/resources/tagion-whitepaper.pdf</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>In addition to resembling a distributed hash table, Tagion&#8217;s infrastructure can also be understood as a sparse Merkle tree (SMT). SMTs are authenticated data structures that operate on key-value pairs, supporting standard database operations like lookup, insertion, updates, and deletions. Each key-value pair represents a leaf, with the hash of the parent branch derived by recursively hashing child nodes up to the Merkle root.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9c553629-5018-49ea-a618-e46c28315d6d_1571x1307.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="1211" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9c553629-5018-49ea-a618-e46c28315d6d_1571x1307.png" width="1456" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Illustration of multi-branch spared Merkle tree.</figcaption></figure></div><p>SMTs significantly enhance efficiency by enabling a prover to verify the presence of an element without having to access unrelated data elements or download the specific data piece. Moreover, the independence of values in the tree allows updates in any order without altering the final structure of the tree.</p><p>Tagion&#8217;s system utilizes the root hash containing all sub-branch hashes to quickly verify data states with minimal computation. To further enhance processing capabilities, the system can create sub-DARTs for specific ecosystems, similar to sharded blockchains. These designated nodes manage subsets of data, increasing throughput and allowing the network to be tailored for various applications akin to app chains.</p><p>Using DART creates a stateless system, removing the need to maintain a complete history of the system's transitions. This means that data can be deleted, resulting in lower storage requirements overall and potentially increasing decentralization of the system by being lightweight.&nbsp;</p><p>Tagion employs HiBON (Hash Invariant Binary Notation Object) to facilitate the storage process further, which guarantees that data remains hash invariant upon entry, streamlining its retrieval based on the associated hash. Hash Invariant simply refers to the property that data will always create the same hash regardless of the order in which it is processed. It's a proven technology used to speed up retrieval and writing of data to a database [2].</p><p>With these mechanisms, Tagion not only securely stores data but also efficiently verifies its inclusion and integrity within the network.</p><h3>Data Integrity&nbsp;</h3><p>All subsystems in Tagion run so-called random walks, checking if data is stored and made available as necessary. Nodes that fail the challenge to verify retention will be excluded from the network.&nbsp;</p><p>All archives contain timestamps requiring payments to extend storage duration. On its walks, the system checks for payments and, if none has been received, will move on to delete the data, freeing up space.</p><h2><strong>Filecoin&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Filecoin is a decentralized storage network that incentivizes miners with its native token, Filecoin, for providing storage capacity. To earn these rewards, miners must generate proofs that verify their storage capacity.</p><p>The fundamental storage unit in Filecoin is known as a sector, which has a standardized size and a lifespan that providers can extend [3]. This design carefully balances security and usability. All user data stored on Filecoin is encrypted, and multiple copies are distributed across the network, ensuring that miners cannot access the contents of the files.</p><p>Miners' influence in the Filecoin network is proportional to the amount of storage they provide, which also allows them to participate in the network's consensus mechanisms. The Filecoin Virtual Machine oversees executing smart contracts and facilitates market operations, such as pairing storage providers with users.</p><p>Filecoin&#8217;s architecture is modular, allowing nodes to operate specific parts of the system as needed. For instance, a node could exclusively function as a storage node without engaging in market operations.</p><p>For data integrity and availability, filecoin relies on two algorithms: Proof of Storage and Proof of Replication.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Proof of Storage&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Miners in Filecoin produce proofs to verify that they hold a copy of data at any given time. This proof is achieved through challenges: the system poses questions to the miners that they can only answer correctly if they have the data.</p><p>To ensure that miners don't just copy the data whenever a challenge is posed, the challenges are designed to target random parts of the data at unpredictable time intervals. The combination of randomness and lack of clarity on intervals makes it impossible, unprofitable, and irrational for miners to fetch data only as challenged [4].&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Proof of Spacetime (PoSt)&nbsp;</strong></h4><p>Going beyond one-time proving, Filecoin introduced Proof of Spacetime (PoSt) to ensure consistent storage and data availability. Proof of Spacetime verifies storage over time intervals by giving miners cryptographic challenges that they can only pass if the file is stored over the indicated timeframe [5].&nbsp;</p><p>PoSt poses two types of challenges:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p><strong>Winning PoSt: </strong>where the miner verifies that they have stored a copy of the data at a specific time, typically when the algorithm selects the miner to mine the next block. The short deadline ensures they have the data.</p></li><li><p><strong>WindowPoSt: </strong>a recurring challenge where miners submit proof that they have maintained the data as required. It would be more expensive for a miner to seal the data only when asked to submit it.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p></li></ul><p>Sealing is part of the Proof-of-Replication algorithm and is computationally intensive, making it desirable to reduce the need to seal as much as possible for a rational miner [5].&nbsp;</p><h3>Proof of Replication</h3><p>Sealing is part of the Proof of Replication algorithm and is computationally intensive, encouraging miners to reduce the frequency of sealing. Proof of Replication assures users that a miner has created and stored a unique copy on their physical hardware. This proof includes:</p><ul><li><p>The data itself.</p></li><li><p>The miner who sealed it.</p></li><li><p>The time and date of sealing.</p></li><li><p>The block height at which the data was sealed.</p></li></ul><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42d54d77-bb30-4057-ae6f-12ed603e87f0_1600x747.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="680" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42d54d77-bb30-4057-ae6f-12ed603e87f0_1600x747.png" width="1456" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Proof Of Replication</figcaption></figure></div><p>Requiring miners to generate both proofs acts as a guarantee for users that files are securely stored and only miners providing actual storage receive rewards. Since the proof is too large to be stored on-chain, miners generate a zkSNARK, which is then submitted onchain, making Filecoin the largest zkSNARK user with 6 - 7 million proofs generated daily [6].</p><p>Overall, Filecoin combines both deterministic proofs (PoRep) and probabilistic proofs (PoSt) for a hybrid approach.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Celestia</strong></h2><p>The third example in this post is Celestia, a so-called data availability blockchain that provides execution and data storage for modular blockchains, allowing them to outsource core functionality.&nbsp;</p><p>With the rise of Ethereum rollups, DA solutions like Celestia have gained popularity for offering a cheaper alternative to host rollup's transaction data than Ethereum archive nodes.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Proving Data Availability</strong></h3><p>Unlike Filecoin, Celestia does not provide a storage solution for end-users but focuses solely on solving data availability issues. Data availability ensures that blockchain data has been properly published. Typically, blockchain nodes must download entire blocks to verify availability, a resource-intensive process that can hinder verifiability.&nbsp;</p><p>To streamline this process, Celestia employs Data Availability Sampling (DAS). This method involves light nodes downloading only a small portion of data until a predetermined confidence level is reached. If the data in the sample is all available, it is considered published, serving as a probabilistic proof of data availability [7].</p><p>Here's how it works:</p><ol><li><p>A proposer creates a data block.</p></li><li><p>The block data is split into <em>k</em>&#215;<em>k</em> chunks, forming a matrix.</p></li><li><p>This matrix is expanded by adding parity data, creating a 2<em>k</em>&#215;2<em>k</em> matrix using Reed-Solomon encoding.

This has resulted in suboptimal user and developer experiences, as the multitude of distinct chains leads to liquidity, app, and user fragmentation. The resulting complex user interface can be challenging for mainstream users to navigate effectively.</p><p>Bridging assets between different chains often involves the confusing and non-intuitive process of wrapping tokens. Moreover, the bridging mechanisms across chains are inconsistent and cumbersome, presenting vulnerabilities and security risks. This lack of standardization not only hinders seamless asset transfer but also exposes users to potential security threats. Additionally, the liquidity of non-native assets on various chains is often limited, further complicating the asset transfer process.</p><p>The recent Bitcoin Renaissance has generated a strong demand for introducing smart contract capabilities into these chains, exacerbating challenges in terms of compatibility and interoperability among different chains.</p><p>To achieve the vision of mass adoption, a unified account system is essential. This system would allow users to interact with applications on various chains seamlessly, with assets being bridged or swapped automatically. This eliminates the need to manage separate accounts for multiple chains, each requiring a different wallet interface. The ability to sign transactions on any chain from a single NEAR account simplifies user interactions through a unified interface, enabling seamless transactions.</p><p>NEAR Protocol stands out as a comprehensive solution for Chain Abstraction, with a core focus on facilitating mass adoption. NEAR aims to lower entry barriers for users, reduce developer friction, and provide seamless services. It allows for account creation and recovery using email addresses, and account usage without needing funds acquisition, and control over accounts on other chains [1]. Despite the complexity of its underlying system, NEAR delivers an easy-to-use platform that enhances the user experience.</p><p>Our focus in this article is to delve into the foundational components of NEAR&#8217;s chain abstraction stack, including Account Abstraction, Frontend Abstraction, and Backend Abstraction. We will also explore potential new use cases enabled by these abstraction layers.</p><h2><strong>Onboarding&nbsp; Abstraction: Native Domain Name System</strong></h2><p>Account Abstraction has been built into every wallet on NEAR protocol since its initial launch in April 2020 despite it being a prominent topic in the Ethereum ecosystem over the past year with EIP 4337 generating significant discussion [2]. However, there remains a lack of consensus on the precise definition of this concept. Often, people tend to include ancillary features such as social login, multi-sig capabilities, and gas fee payments under the umbrella of Account Abstraction. Essentially, Account Abstraction refers to the ability to programmatically establish the validity conditions of a transaction and to utilize smart contracts for its execution.</p><p>Conversely, NEAR Protocol introduces a native domain name system, associating human-readable accounts with numerous keys that possess varying permissions for different functionalities. NEAR also offers the functionality to convert externally owned accounts (EOAs) into smart contracts. Thus, what is considered "Account Abstraction" on other blockchain platforms is an inherent aspect of NEAR&#8217;s architecture, representing a built-in feature within the protocol.</p><h3><strong>.near is the Original Account Abstraction</strong></h3><p>The .near account model forms the foundation for NEAR&#8217;s smart contracts, offering high composability and extensive user possibilities.</p><p>FastAuth is a pivotal key management system that enables users to recover or sign up for a NEAR account using their email addresses. This feature provides a Web2-like onboarding experience without the need to store a seed phrase or password. Instead, keys are safeguarded through advanced "Passkeys" technology, which replaces passwords with biometric data such as fingerprints or FaceID linked to a specific device. Users can regain access to their accounts at any time using their email through the MPC recovery service.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7002a8a2-d572-4f26-8e7a-f3d3c519080c_1328x780.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="780" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7002a8a2-d572-4f26-8e7a-f3d3c519080c_1328x780.png" width="1328" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">FastAuth (Source: Near Protocol)</figcaption></figure></div><p>The upcoming version of FastAuth, scheduled for release this month, will include mappings for NEAR addresses to EVM, Bitcoin, and other blockchain addresses. This feature will enable NEAR accounts to initiate transaction signing for other chains, thereby facilitating the seamless development of multichain applications directly within NEAR&#8217;s smart contract environment [3].</p><h3><strong>.tg Opens New Era</strong></h3><p>Each NEAR account can be associated with various access key pairs. If we consider a NEAR account as a real person, it can hold different keys to access various protocols, or even different keys to navigate different chains with distinct signature algorithms.</p><p>The integration with Telegram due to NEAR&#8217;s WebAssembly-based run time, has fully unlocked its potential. Until now, NEAR Protocol users have been confined to one top-level domain, .near. However, the introduction of the .tg domain opens the door to a multitude of opportunities. Now, any other widely-used platform can secure its top-level domain on the NEAR Protocol, such as .x, .ins, and more [4].</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F78e9e23a-50ed-495d-a2a7-b401b0ed36f7_1344x756.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="756" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F78e9e23a-50ed-495d-a2a7-b401b0ed36f7_1344x756.png" width="1344" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">.tg Domain (Source: Here Wallet)</figcaption></figure></div><p>Leading mainstream exchanges have already started supporting deposits and withdrawals to and from .tg accounts, paving the way for smoother integration of additional top-level domains.</p><p>Telegram has proven to be a gateway to mass adoption through HOT DAO, a multichain MPC network that allows users to create and manage wallets on Telegram. <a href="https://dappradar.com/dapp/hot-game?range-ds=30d">According to DappRadar</a>, HOT DAO has had&nbsp; an average of 3.88 million weekly active users over the last 30 days. This app alone if more weekly active users than all of Solana, Base, and BNB combined (<a href="https://dappradar.com/rankings/chains?sort=uawCount&amp;order=desc">on June 5th, 2024</a>). <br /><br />This wallet showcases that the user experience can mirror familiar mobile applications. Moreover, it has the ability to introduce multi-chain functionality, offering chain-agnostic Dapps for users.</p><h1><strong>Frontend Abstraction</strong></h1><h3><strong>The Gateway to NEAR Protocol</strong></h3><p>The Web Assembly powered Blockchain Operating System (BOS) marks NEAR Protocol&#8217;s pioneering step towards the Open Web. While NEAR is not the first public chain that can host static resources, it is the first to propose a composable and decentralized frontend approach. By harnessing the cost-effective storage and computation capabilities of the NEAR Blockchain, NEAR Components&#8217; code is fully stored on-chain within the SocialDB smart contract.</p><p>A composable decentralized frontend refers to a framework that seamlessly integrates with any Web2 or Web3 backend, as well as any wallet. BOS inherits React&#8217;s design, where each component is built on top of a React Component. This structure facilitates easy contributions from a large developer community proficient in JavaScript to the open-source library. Notably, many frontend components are reusable through the fork protocol, as exemplified by DEX platforms modeled after Uniswap.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F856d9f54-1990-4946-a909-240caba921af_1410x698.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="698" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F856d9f54-1990-4946-a909-240caba921af_1410x698.png" width="1410" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">BOS (Source: NEAR Protocol)</figcaption></figure></div><p>In addition to that, the LEGO block-like composition of components allows for the construction of complex applications. This method simplifies the process of launching a unified platform that provides users with a comprehensive experience and facilitates their navigation through protocols on a single page. The NEAR official website, near.org, serves not only as a social platform but also as a component store for developers and a Dapp store for users.</p><p>Interoperability between NEAR components and smart contracts is often overlooked when discussing BOS. NEAR Components can seamlessly interact with smart contracts on the NEAR Blockchain. While view methods permit querying by anyone free of charge, call methods necessitate user authentication.</p><h3><strong>A Gateway to L2s</strong></h3><p>A decentralized frontend can provide easy-to-use components for building in a chain-abstracted manner.&nbsp;</p><p>DapDap serves as the universal gateway to Ethereum L2s, offering a seamless and user-friendly platform that simplifies navigation across the DeFi landscape by consolidating it into a single UI. Supporting 10+ Ethereum L2s and over 100 dApps, DapDap stands out as the ultimate DeFi solution for effortless onboarding and seamless exploration of the open web.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95a8f555-508f-46cb-96a8-bbf8b33c765d_1342x724.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="724" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95a8f555-508f-46cb-96a8-bbf8b33c765d_1342x724.png" width="1342" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">DapDap Gateway (Source: DapDap)</figcaption></figure></div><p>Moreover, DapDap is not limited solely to L2s; the ecosystem and protocols within EVM chains are essentially the same, encompassing decentralized exchanges, lending platforms, and NFT marketplaces. This uniformity enables the creation of a comprehensive platform that spans various EVM chains, offering users a one-stop solution for navigating the decentralized finance space.</p><h1><strong>Backend Abstraction: Chain Signatures</strong></h1><h3><strong>TSS</strong></h3><p>The underlying technology facilitating this is Chain Signatures, a pioneering threshold signature protocol that leverages a multi-party computation (MPC) signer network on NEAR.</p><p>While MPC itself is not new&#8212;having been used in solutions like the Coinbase Wallet, where users retain one key and centralized parties retain others&#8212;it offers several distinct advantages:</p><ol><li><p>The user experience remains consistent with traditional applications.</p></li><li><p>MPC can support any chain, whether it supports smart contracts or not (ie: Bitcoin and Doge).</p></li><li><p>It supports underlying elliptic curves compatible with multiple chains concurrently.

As Layer 2 rollup solutions gain traction, addressing the challenges of efficient and cost-effective data storage has become paramount. NEAR's DA solution presents a comprehensive architecture meticulously designed to leverage the network's inherent high speeds and low costs, providing a robust and scalable storage layer tailored for rollup data.</p><p>At the core of NEAR DA&nbsp; lies the Blob Store Contract, a specialized smart contract that enables the decentralized storage of arbitrary DA blobs directly on the NEAR blockchain.

Additional to this innovative storage solution is the Light Client, a trustless off-chain component that facilitates advanced features such as KZG commitments, erasure coding, and storage connectors. This versatile client empowers rollup providers to construct sophisticated proving systems by verifying transaction and receipt inclusion proofs, further enhancing the trustworthiness and transparency of the DA solution. Moreover, the DA RPC Client serves as the primary interface for seamless interaction with NEAR's DA system, offering a consistent and simplified experience across various programming languages.

Users have a high demand for DeFi platforms that are functional across multiple chains. Some notable use cases include native cross-chain swaps (such as exchanging $XRP on Ripple for an NFT on Solana), the implementation of a cross-chain lending order book (e.g., utilizing X on Optimism as collateral to borrow Y on Arbitrum), and the ability to restake any asset on any chain while managing the associated reward or slashing conditions from NEAR.</p><p>This capability is particularly valuable for apps like DapDap, which is developed on NEAR Protocol and allows users to explore and engage with DeFi apps from different layer 2 solutions within a unified interface [10]. While DapDap currently provides the on-chain frontend component for interacting with layer 2 solutions, users still need to switch network settings on MetaMask to sign transactions. What if users could simply log in to their NEAR wallet and sign transactions on any desired blockchain?</p><p>NEAR Protocol has introduced a novel solution that potentially offers the most cost-effective way to trade assets on-chain without concerns about high transaction fees and latency on legacy chains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Through a smart contract, users can trade derivative paths, enabling them to trade specific assets deposited in a remote account without involving the entire account in the transaction process. For example, a decentralized exchange (Dex) could maintain path derivations of asset ownership on various chains and facilitate direct asset trading from remote addresses without incurring settlement fees on other blockchains.</p><h1><strong>Conclusion: Prerequisite to User-Owned AI&nbsp;</strong></h1><p>NEAR's chain abstraction stack presents a solution to the fragmented blockchain landscape, enabling seamless interactions across all chains. This approach unites Account Abstraction, Frontend Abstraction, Backend Abstraction, Liquidity Abstraction, and Data Abstraction, empowering users to engage with the decentralized ecosystem as seamlessly as they would with their favorite centralized applications.</p><p>However, NEAR's vision extends far beyond mere chain interoperability. The ultimate goal is to provide a fully sovereign operating system equipped with a personal AI assistant that optimizes for users' needs without compromising privacy. This platform will empower peer-to-peer interactions and transactions between individual user-owned AIs, while also facilitating the establishment of shared community AIs governed by their respective members [12].</p><p>These community AIs will represent the collective knowledge and requirements of their constituents, ranging from small clubs and startups to cities, nation-states, and even global-scale communities. With the ability to fork existing communities and create new ones, governed by the members themselves, this ecosystem fosters innovation and self-determination. By selectively curating the data used for training and enabling private inference with cryptographic proofs, these community models ensure transparency and verifiability, paving the way for a future where AI is truly owned and controlled by the people.</p><p>As the NEAR ecosystem continues to evolve, its focus on harnessing the potential of verifiable, user-owned AI will become increasingly paramount. By leveraging the chain abstraction infrastructure, NEAR is poised to facilitate the development of innovative AI applications that transcend blockchains, empowering individuals and communities to shape the future of the open web.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Thanks for reading Stanford Blockchain Review!

Source [1].</figcaption></figure></div><p>In the summer of 2022, LVMH made a splash with the NFTiff Pendant, a first-of-its-kind limited edition pendant featuring the iconography of Cryptopunk NFTs. Tiffany &amp; Co. minted a collection of 250 digital passes as part of the NFTiff collection, which were able to be purchased and redeemed by CryptoPunks holders for a custom pendant crafted by Tiffany &amp; Co. with the iconography of the holder&#8217;s CryptoPunk [2]. Within each crafted pendant, there are at least 30 gemstones used, including Sapphires, Amethyst, and Spinel, and made with 18k rose or yellow gold, depending on the specific color of each CryptoPunk [2]. With its custom-built design and exclusive offering to Cryptopunk holders, the NFTiff was a daring step towards a whole new world, where luxury fashion intersected with an icon of crypto culture.</p><p>Yet, the shiny announcement of the NFTiff is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to LVMH&#8217;s experimentation and innovation in the web3 sphere; behind the scenes, the luxury conglomerate has taken huge strides to reinvent the concept of &#8220;digital luxury.&#8221; In this article, we will explore a wide range of LVMH&#8217;s web3 projects, from the development of Digital Product Passports on the luxury-focused Aura blockchain, to 3D &#8220;Digital Twins&#8221;, to co-creation communities and beyond. In this process, we will discuss how the conglomerate has expanded their luxury empire into the metaverse, and what this might look like for the consumer of the future.</p><h2>Digital Product Passports and Aura Blockchain</h2><p>One of the biggest trends in the digital luxury space is the rise of &#8220;Digital Product Passports.&#8221; As part of a new sustainability law, the European Union has introduced a Digital Product Passport mandate for all durable consumer goods, with the aim to improve supply-chain traceability, enhance product authenticity, and create a more sustainable consumer economy [3].</p><p>Essentially, a &#8220;Digital Product Passport&#8221; is a digital &#8220;identity card&#8221; for a given consumer product, created as an NFC chip or QR code embedded in each consumer product that can link to online information about the product&#8217;s supply chain details, provenance, and attest to its authenticity. And blockchains, both general-purpose public blockchains such as Ethereum or Polygon, and enterprise-focused permissioned blockchains, have emerged as a major way to implement this Digital Product Passport mandate.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe6640fb-3140-49bf-ba16-57fb535ef24d_1600x891.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="811" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe6640fb-3140-49bf-ba16-57fb535ef24d_1600x891.png" width="1456" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Aura Blockchain Homepage. Source [4].</figcaption></figure></div><p>In 2021, LVMH co-founded the Aura Blockchain Consortium with brands such as Mercedes-Benz, Prada Group, and Cartier to create the luxury-specific Aura blockchain. One of Aura&#8217;s missions is to create Digital Product Passport NFTs for its member brands and other well-known luxury retailers [5].</p><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Here&#8217;s how [Digital Product Passports] work in practice. A designer handbag is fitted with a QR code as it leaves the warehouse destined for the store. As well as a QR code, any other type of authentication technology could be used, such as an NFC chip.</em></p><p><em>When someone buys the bag, they scan the QR code on the item, claim its ownership, easily certify its authenticity and access all of the product information. The certificate of authenticity lasts forever and will always be available digitally. The owner has full control of their data. If they later want to take it back to the store for maintenance, they can prove that the bag hasn&#8217;t been found or stolen by demonstrating ownership via the Aura Blockchain Consortium platform. Similarly, bags sold on the secondary market are instantly verified as genuine, obviating the need for checks, and enabling simple transfers to the new owner to ensure they have the same access as the previous owner to the information about the product.&#8221;&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>&#8211;&#8211; Aura Blockchain Consortium, cofounded by LVMH. Source [5].</em></p></blockquote><p>On the backend, the Aura Consortium maintains the Aura Multi-Token Minter (MTM), which is a platform that allows brands to mint and distribute tokens across multiple blockchains. These tokens include Ethereum ERC-721 standard Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), Soul-Bound Tokens (SBTs), Proof of Attendance NFTs, and more. Moreover, since the MTM uses Ethereum ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standards in its minting process, Digital Product Passports and other token assets can be minted across multiple blockchains, from permissioned blockchains such as Aura to public blockchains such as Etheruem and Polygon, with all of the metadata of the Digital Product Passport stored on IPFS [6].</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff47d7543-ec5c-4f2f-b5af-4c5ebfcd8584_1170x986.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="986" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff47d7543-ec5c-4f2f-b5af-4c5ebfcd8584_1170x986.png" width="1170" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Dior B33 Digital Product Passport. Source [7]</figcaption></figure></div><p>An example of Aura&#8217;s Digital Product Passports in action is Dior&#8217;s B33 Sneakers. Each pair of these sneakers comes with a DPP that acts as the shoe&#8217;s certificate of authenticity, allows the user to gain insights into the shoe&#8217;s manufacturing process, and enables the user to receive exclusive updates about Dior&#8217;s upcoming sneaker releases. Aura&#8217;s Multi-Token Minter implements the B33 Digital Product Passport as an ERC-721 token on Ethereum [8].</p><h2>Digital Twins as a Medium for &#8220;Savoir Faire&#8221;</h2><p>LVMH&#8217;s vision for web3, however, doesn&#8217;t just stop at Aura Blockchain&#8217;s Digital Product Passports. One of LVMH&#8217;s goals in the space is to use &#8220;digital twins&#8221; as a medium of &#8220;savoir faire&#8221; to convey the historic craftsmanship for each of their luxury brands. This digital storytelling is increasingly important in the context of younger generations, as their first point of contact with a brand is often through digital venues, such as on social media or on a brand&#8217;s website.</p><p>This is part of the rationale why in June 2023, LVMH announced a partnership with Epic Games, the creator of Fortnite and Unreal Engine, to transform the maison&#8217;s creative pipeline with cutting edge rendering technology [9]. From digital twins to virtual fashion shows and 360 product carousels, this strategic partnership will allow LVMH to continue to apply their brands&#8217; storytelling expertise with this new medium of digital collectibles.</p><h3>Bulgari&#8217;s &#8220;Beyond Wonder&#8221; Digital Jewel</h3><p>One pioneering example of a &#8220;digital twin&#8221; is Bulgari&#8217;s 2022 NFT jewel series. This series contained two multi-million euro necklaces, the &#8220;Magnifica Ruby Metamorphosis&#8221; and &#8220;Emerald Glory&#8221; necklace, both of which give the buyer a physical product and a NFT &#8220;digital twin&#8221; [10]. In addition, this collection also featured a third not-for-sale jewel called &#8220;beyond wonder&#8221; which Bulgari claims to be the first pure NFT jewel [10].</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05e0d0d3-e360-4452-94aa-43056a80886f_1200x801.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="801" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05e0d0d3-e360-4452-94aa-43056a80886f_1200x801.png" width="1200" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Bulgari 2022 NFT Jewel Series. Source [11].&nbsp;</figcaption></figure></div><p>Curated by Japanese artist Azuma Makoto, who is known for his experimental floral and botanical art, the immaculate creative setup of this jewelry collection shows how Bulgari seeks to convey the idea of high luxury within the digital sphere while embracing a spirit of innovation. One of the core ideas behind &#8220;Beyond Wonder&#8221; is to create an intangible form of art that transcends material boundaries. Thus, this collection powerfully conveys Bulgari&#8217;s brand as a bold innovator in high-end luxury that seamlessly blends together heritage with innovation.</p><h3>Louis Vuitton&#8217;s VIA Program</h3><p>Another more extensive experiment of &#8220;digital twins&#8221; is Louis Vuitton&#8217;s VIA program. In June 2023, Louis Vuitton introduced its VIA program with the debut of its &#8220;VIA Treasure Trunk&#8221; [12]. Collectors were invited to purchase a $42,000 non-transferrable digital collectible of the iconic LV treasure trunk, which served as a soul-bound token recording membership in the VIA program [12].</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d018179-0efd-4f3f-9af9-d10ccc21a8f8_1600x830.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="755" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d018179-0efd-4f3f-9af9-d10ccc21a8f8_1600x830.png" width="1456" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Louis Vuitton VIA Treasure Trunk Website and OpenSea page. Sources [13] [14]</figcaption></figure></div><p>Owners of the VIA Treasure Trunk could then participate in exclusive VIP events, for which they also received Proof of Attendance NFTs. This membership token also enabled them to purchase transferable &#8220;digital twins&#8221; of subsequent physical products in the program, with all of these collectibles being available to sell on secondary markets [12].</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9343c9b1-dfab-4afc-bc48-718dbc99afb5_1600x854.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="777" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9343c9b1-dfab-4afc-bc48-718dbc99afb5_1600x854.png" width="1456" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Louis Vuitton VIA Products. Source [12] [15] [16]</figcaption></figure></div><p>Over the past year, there have been several products released in the VIA program. First, in July 2023, LV released an exclusive Pharell Williams&#8217; orange monogram &#8220;Speedy 40&#8221; bag, where the orange colorway was only available to VIA Trunk holders [15]. Next, in November 2023, the maison released a mini-trunk designed by Nicolas Ghesqui&#232;re for the Spring/Summer 2024 runway, the &#8220;VIA Tile Trunk&#8221; [16]. Most recently, in April 2024, the program released a third item, a Western-style varsity jacket that appeared on LV&#8217;s Fall/Winter 2024 runway [12]. This jacket also marks the VIA program&#8217;s first ready-to-wear garment, reimagined as an NFT from the brand. Thus, through the VIA program, Louis Vuitton is reimagining the digital luxury experience, using token-gating as a mechanism to convey a sense of digital exclusivity and brand loyalty.</p><h3>Hennessy Caf&#233; 11</h3><p>Another exploration of brand loyalty is in Hennessy&#8217;s Caf&#233; 11 project, which has sought to create an exclusive community-curated loyalty program. Inspired by the freethinking Parisian cafe culture of the 1920s, Caf&#233; 11 seeks to curate novel cultural experiences for a digital-first community. This includes communing with artists and cultural icons, attending exclusive in-person events, and a novel culinary experience [17].</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3efa60e2-05c8-4da2-b4c2-5200ece99df1_1600x855.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="778" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3efa60e2-05c8-4da2-b4c2-5200ece99df1_1600x855.png" width="1456" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Hennessy Caf&#233; 11. Source [17]</figcaption></figure></div><p>Partnering with the Friends with Benefits DAO, Henessy allowed members of this online community to participate in its creative process, working with New York artist Johnsville to reimagine the iconic Hennessy V.S.O.P. Bottle. Participants in Caf&#233; 11 were also invited to curated events, such as at Miami Basel 2022 [17]. Thus, Hennessy&#8217;s Caf&#233; 11 may be considered an early experiment of a &#8220;Cultural DAO,&#8221; where the token-gated community itself becomes a collective of cultural change-makers that take part in shaping a brand&#8217;s future.</p><h3>The Vision of Digital Twins</h3><p>So, what is the overarching purpose for LVMH&#8217;s introduction of digital twins and these web3 community programs? Because there are a wide variety of brands, with everything from handbags to shoes to beverages, there does not really exist a one-size-fits-all method to implement &#8220;digital twins&#8221; and other metaverse ideas across the board. But there are a few general principles that hold, which provide the rationale for LVMH&#8217;s move into the metaverse [18].</p><p>For many of LVMH&#8217;s products, their value greatly depends on their social symbolism as items of prestige and luxury. This is why there is a consistent emphasis on using these digital tools, such as Unreal Engine, to convey a sense of artisanship and &#8220;savoir faire&#8221;.</p><p>But more importantly, these digital collectibles augment the physical experience of a brand. Many of these experiments, such as LV&#8217;s VIA Treasure Trunk or Hennessy&#8217;s Caf&#233; 11, enhance the social experience of luxury for these brands; they connect end users with both the world-class designers and artists behind these brands, as well as with each other. While becoming digital is key to innovating the client journey, we as humans are always naturally drawn towards the fully-immersive nature of physical products, particularly for inherently social luxury products. Thus, what these digital collectibles ultimately seek to do is to bring the client back to the physical, back to the social and experiential nature of these products.</p><h2>Conclusion: Bringing Your Handbag to Web3</h2><p>Throughout history, one of fashion&#8217;s core traits is that it is a trendsetter and distribution channel, one that can integrate once-fringe products and subcultures into the mainstream &#8211; sometimes without even consumers realizing. It is very plausible that in the near future, blockchain technology, such as NFTs and crypto wallets, will be so seamlessly integrated into retail applications that consumers will barely notice the innovation in the backend tech.</p><p>So what might the future of &#8220;digital luxury&#8221; look like, to the everyday consumer of the future?</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c7cb96e-fe91-4820-abd2-fa10cf07081f_1600x936.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="852" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c7cb96e-fe91-4820-abd2-fa10cf07081f_1600x936.png" width="1456" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Louis Vuitton App Screenshots on Google Play Store. Source [19].&nbsp;</figcaption></figure></div><p>Take the Louis Vuitton app, for example. Imagine that in the future, all the handbags displayed here on the digital store are actually represented as NFTs on the backend. When you go and select a bag to buy on the app, you actually connect to a digital wallet in the app. After the purchase, you automatically purchase the product&#8217;s &#8220;Digital Twin,&#8221; an AR-animated digital collectible that you can display, perhaps even show off in a metaverse game or social media platform. When you go to a retail store, showing this digital collectible will allow you to redeem the physical item, as well as be eligible for customer care and other loyalty experiences &#8211; such as product shows or co-creation programs.</p><p>To take things even further, the &#8220;myLV&#8221; panel in the app could be technically realized in the future as a noncustodial crypto wallet, where the private keys are stored on your local device and protected by FaceID and other biometrics. Your purchase collection in the &#8220;myLV&#8221; panel consists of all the &#8220;Digital Twin&#8221; NFTs to your previous purchases. You can click to view the Digital Product Passport to each one, as well as transact them on second-hand markets with any user that has a crypto wallet through a QR code.</p><p>Crucially, all of this integrated wallet UX is possible with current blockchain infrastructure through Wallet-as-a-Service providers. And as these technologies gain greater adoption, perhaps most end-users may not even realize that NFTs and blockchain technology are being used on the backend. One day, at a family dinner, a distant aunt or cousin may just say, &#8220;Hey look, my LV handbag is on my phone!&#8221; without any idea that what they&#8217;re holding up is an NFT.</p><p>And perhaps that is the instant when blockchain technology breaks into the mainstream.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Thanks for reading Stanford Blockchain Review!

This article is a long-form exploration of our discussions, drawing upon their experience in crypto and trends they have noticed throughout their research to build a sense of what will occur in the coming years for crypto.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>This article focuses on 3 major topics from our discussion: Developer Activity, Crypto Social, and NFTs.</em></p><h2>Developer Activity</h2><p>Every year, Electric Capital publishes their Annual Developer Report, which is read by hundreds of thousands seeking the most meaningful insights into crypto developer activity across various ecosystems.</p><p>To compile this report, Electric fingerprints over 480 million crypto-related code commits across more than 800 thousand repositories [1]. This extensive analysis provides valuable insights into crypto developer activity. Additionally, Electric maintains an open-source <a href="https://github.com/electric-capital/crypto-ecosystems">Crypto Ecosystems Taxonomy</a> that users can contribute to, and collaborates with major foundations like Optimism, NEAR, and Solana to include the latest data on chains and ecosystems.</p><p>Why the developer report? The developer report began in 2018, following the 2017 ICO craze, with the aim of cutting through the noise in the crypto space. Given crypto tremendous volatility, undue importance is often placed on the wrong quantitative measures, like price action, to gauge progress. However, this approach is misguided.</p><p>If we believe crypto is a fundamentally game-changing technology where developers can build entirely new applications, the key behavior to measure is not price action but developer engagement. We should focus on the people who are committed to making long-term investments in crypto, dedicating their time to building infrastructure and applications for users.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc29b450-aa0e-47bb-ab43-57bbb28ba126_1364x764.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="764" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc29b450-aa0e-47bb-ab43-57bbb28ba126_1364x764.png" width="1364" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Separating Signal From Noise: Despite prices having tumbled, established developer numbers grew in 2023</figcaption></figure></div><p>Which ecosystems are developers choosing to build on? How is the US faring in crypto developer activity? Which types of infrastructure and applications are developers currently most excited about? By answering these questions, the Annual Developer Report provides powerful information to help new developers decide which blockchain to build on, assist governments in making better crypto policy decisions, and guide investors to areas where innovation is truly bubbling.</p><p>Here are three favorite insights utilizing Electric&#8217;s Developer Data:</p><p><strong>Insight #1: The Future Is Multichain</strong></p><p>The future is clearly multichain. More than 30% of developers now support more than one chain, up from just 3% in 2015, marking a 10x increase. Additionally, developers supporting 3 or more chains have grown to 17% of all developers in 2023, an all-time high.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F62462c70-415a-4c65-8f02-4c46534a8e28_1370x760.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="760" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F62462c70-415a-4c65-8f02-4c46534a8e28_1370x760.png" width="1370" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption"> Growth of Multi-Chain Developers throughout time</figcaption></figure></div><p>With Electric&#8217;s Developer Report, one can delve even deeper into developer behaviors. The 2023 network graph illustrates which crypto ecosystems have overlapping developers. It may not be surprising to see that Ethereum shares a significant number of developers with Layer 2 solutions like Optimism and Polygon, as well as EVM-compatible chains like BNB and Avalanche. However, it may be interesting to discover the extent of the overlap between Polkadot and Cosmos developers or to learn that many Solana developers also work on Bitcoin.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd4f113ed-2a13-4c24-8bf2-e245ebf621f4_1600x860.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="783" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd4f113ed-2a13-4c24-8bf2-e245ebf621f4_1600x860.png" width="1456" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">2023 Network Graph Overlapping Developer Ecosystems</figcaption></figure></div><p>These types of insights can be quite powerful for various use cases. Teams can use them to determine which chain to expand their developer infrastructure to next. Ecosystem teams can identify the types of developers building on their chain, and investors can focus their attention on a specific subset of crypto ecosystems.</p><p><strong>Insight #2: The US is Losing Developer Share</strong></p><p>By analyzing self-reported GitHub location data and their commits to repositories, it becomes easier to gain insights into developer activity in different regions. For 2023&#8217;s data, Europe and Central Asia account for the majority of developer activity (36%), with North America accounting for the second most activity (28%). While France and Germany each have over a 5% share of crypto developers, India alone accounts for 12% of 2023 crypto developers.</p><p>Electric not only gathers insights from the current year&#8217;s regional developer data but also provides insights into regional behaviors over time. One of the most interesting findings is that while the overall developer ecosystem has grown, the US is losing significant developer share. Innovation in crypto is increasingly concentrated outside of the US.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf387381-ceb6-4869-b043-a420a2f39e67_1600x814.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="741" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf387381-ceb6-4869-b043-a420a2f39e67_1600x814.png" width="1456" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">U.S Developer Share Over Time</figcaption></figure></div><p>This data, which highlights the clear problem of U.S. innovation moving offshore, has been cited by policymakers in the House of Representatives to push for regulatory clarity for U.S. developers and crypto companies [2].</p><p><strong>Insight #3: The Advent of Bitcoin L2s and Base</strong></p><p>Electric&#8217;s data shows significant developer growth in two major ecosystems: Bitcoin and Base.</p><p>Bitcoin is an excellent example of how Electric identifies meaningful signals amidst the noise when measuring crypto progress. Despite extreme volatility, Bitcoin development has remained consistently strong over time: every year since 2017, over a thousand new developers have joined the Bitcoin ecosystem. Furthermore, with the growth of Bitcoin Ordinals, which have caused transaction volumes to spike, and excitement around innovations like Fraud Proofs and proposals such as OP_CAT, there has been a noticeable increase in developer activity focused on Bitcoin scaling solutions [3].</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3b401b41-5136-4d79-953e-c797e5faa108_1600x813.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="740" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3b401b41-5136-4d79-953e-c797e5faa108_1600x813.png" width="1456" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Work On Bitcoin Scaling Solutions Has Grown Over Time</figcaption></figure></div><p>Another ecosystem to watch in 2024 is Base. Since its launch over a year ago, Base has grown to have a thousand monthly active developers, which is unprecedented for new crypto ecosystems.</p><p>Overall, crypto is experiencing fragmentation across developer ecosystems. The advent of Bitcoin Layer 2s and new chains like Base means a lot of experimentation will occur. Fragmentation seems like it will continue until developers figure out what truly works, ultimately leading to consolidation as they focus on a more specific subset of chains.</p><h2><strong>Crypto Social</strong></h2><p>With the improvement of crypto infrastructure, the surface area of possibilities for users has dramatically expanded. While a previous transaction to buy an NFT on Ethereum&#8217;s L1 in 2021 could have cost hundreds of dollars, low gas fees and higher throughput using L2s like Base enable new experimentation, especially for social use cases.</p><p>Because crypto now offers a better user experience for applications that require more interactive on-chain moments, social applications have seen widespread adoption across the crypto space. Friendtech, a social application that enables creators to create gated chat rooms for fans, and Farcaster, a decentralized social media protocol that allows clients to be built on top of it, are two such popular applications.</p><p><strong>BasePaint</strong></p><p>However, crypto is still in its early stages. Crypto social is reminiscent of social media in 2003&#8212;a period marked by massive experimentation. There are fun applications such as Basepaint, a shared pixel canvas application. In Basepaint, users can mint brushes to contribute to the canvas, and after 24 hours, an Open Edition is minted. The profits from this Open Edition are then distributed proportionally to the artists based on the number of pixels they contributed [4].</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F341d2ab7-8c17-467f-b546-6ec8a235dfc6_1600x760.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="692" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F341d2ab7-8c17-467f-b546-6ec8a235dfc6_1600x760.png" width="1456" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>Source: &nbsp;Metaversal.banklesshq.com/p/basepaint</em></figcaption></figure></div><p><strong>WorldPvP</strong></p><p>Another example is WorldPvP, a Base social application and experiment where 221 countries, each represented by their own ERC-20 token, compete to see who can achieve the highest market cap and control the nuke.

On-chain experiments like WorldPvP suggest that the next social application could be even more gamified than its Web2 counterparts.</p><h2><strong>NFTs</strong></h2><p>Electric, which is also a lead investor in MagicEden, the leading NFT marketplace, has several insights into the NFT ecosystem. Here are two we discussed.</p><p><strong>NFTs Are Multichain</strong></p><p>NFTPulse, a tool built by Electric to quantify and display the latest NFT-related data across ecosystems, demonstrates that NFT volumes are increasingly multichain [6]. While Ethereum NFT volumes dominated in 2021 and 2022, the rise of Solana and Bitcoin Ordinals in late 2023 challenged the notion that Ethereum would remain the dominant player. At times, weekly NFT volumes from Bitcoin Ordinals have even surpassed those of Ethereum.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F51352222-ea32-4b9d-8cc7-8d8331711239_1162x860.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="860" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F51352222-ea32-4b9d-8cc7-8d8331711239_1162x860.png" width="1162" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption"> Up until fall of 2023, Ethereum often received more than 90% of weekly volume.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Even though the UX of buying a NFT on different blockchains differ, NFTs represent digital culture. With the advent of Ordinals, people who enjoy supporting and being part of the Bitcoin ecosystem can buy and sell Bitcoin NFTs. As Solana grows and develops its own unique culture, Solana NFTs have become increasingly popular within the Solana community.</p><p><strong>It Is Hard To Be Bearish NFTs</strong></p><p>It is quite hard to be bearish on NFTs. As we move towards a more digital world, the need for ownership of digital objects becomes essential. We are in the early stages of EU laws mandating that all fashion goods and consumer products must be fitted with &#8220;Digital Product Passports&#8221; or NFTs for authenticity and verification of ownership by 2026 [7]. Furthermore, while markets may be very cyclical, NFTs, due to their nature as digital objects, will serve as the foundation for digital music, real estate, collectibles, and luxury goods.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0cfe7f62-7b4f-40b1-b90b-5db407e56aa8_1356x680.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="680" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0cfe7f62-7b4f-40b1-b90b-5db407e56aa8_1356x680.png" width="1356" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Despite NFT activity dying off throughout the bear, transactions are beginning to increase again</figcaption></figure></div><p><strong>Emotional Connection</strong></p><p>NFTs differ from fungible tokens because they can create a deep emotional connection with the holder. A used teddy bear bought for $20 may be worth less than $20 to most people; however, to the owner, that specific teddy bear may hold much greater value. NFTs, which include digital art and profile picture collections, behave similarly for their owners.</p><p>NFT owners often form emotional bonds with their holdings. Avichal and Maria, both NFT enthusiasts, understand this deeply from their personal experiences. For them, NFTs are more than just tradable financial assets. Avichal co-owns several Fidenzas by artist Tyler Hobbs and proudly displays physical prints in his home [8]. Maria owns a Milady and even commissioned a custom portrait of it, highlighting the personal significance these digital assets can hold [9].</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd6ed6048-078d-43fb-9850-765ac9769ee0_894x906.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="389.1543624161074" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd6ed6048-078d-43fb-9850-765ac9769ee0_894x906.png" width="384" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Commissioned Portrait of Maria&#8217;s Milady&nbsp;</figcaption></figure></div><h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>Many of the payment rails and systems we use today, such as automated clearing houses and credit card systems, were established in the 60s and 70s [10]. Crypto fundamentally reimagines these systems, allowing one to solve new problems and opening up the design space for entirely new applications.</p><p>With the advent of low-gas fee and higher throughput blockchains like Base, we are witnessing a wave of exciting experimentation in crypto social. Early successes like Friendtech and Farcaster, along with innovative experiments like Basepaint and WorldPvP, make this era feel reminiscent of social networks back in 2003. The increasing importance of NFTs, which are essentially digital objects, seems inevitable in a world that is becoming more and more digital. This is an incredibly exciting time for crypto, and Electric is eager to see how it all unfolds.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Thanks for reading the Stanford Blockchain Review!

<div> 关键词：《Oracle》、区块链、智能合约、犯罪、技术警示

总结:<br />
"Ari Juels的新作《Oracle》是一部融合区块链、古希腊神话与艺术犯罪的加密惊悚小说。小说灵感来源于作者对区块链技术的研究论文和曼哈顿的天桥办公室。书中探讨了‘恶名昭彰的智能合约’概念，它们被设计用于犯罪，引发对技术滥用的警示。随着技术进步，如ChatGPT，书中某些设想变得更具可行性。《Oracle》通过引人入胜的故事，教育公众理解区块链技术的复杂性及其潜在的社会影响，同时反思技术发明者与技术后果的关系。" <div>

That&#8217;s the premise that Ari Juels explores in his new crypto thriller &#8220;The Oracle&#8221; [1], where a blockchain developer becomes the target of a bounty on his death, ostensibly commanded by the Greek god Apollo. In this article, we will explore the conception of this crypto-themed thriller novel, one that blends together themes as disparate as blockchains, ancient Greek mythology, and art crime. First, we will explore the sources of inspiration for this novel, then we will dive into some of the themes within the novel, before finally reflecting on the wider significance of the novel in illuminating the notoriously complex crypto space for the general public.</p><h1>Origins of the Novel</h1><p>The crypto industry has been, from its inception, a cradle of lore and legend. From Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, to the spectacular rise and fall of Sam Bankman Fried (SBF) and FTX, the blockchain space is known for its colorful personalities and seemingly absurd tales. All this makes the nascent industry almost uniquely suited for a thriller novel like &#8220;The Oracle,&#8221; one where every page keeps the reader on the edge of their seat.&nbsp;</p><p>In many ways, the novel serves an introduction to the potential ramifications of blockchain technology for the general public. Unlike academic papers or blog posts, whose focuses are often on technical details for a blockchain-native audience, perhaps the most important part of a thriller novel is its ability to maintain a sense of tension that keeps the reader &#8220;hooked&#8221; in. Like many novels, although elements within the book may be arranged for literary purposes, many of the key ideas in the plot are inspired by real events and technologies.</p><p>The idea for the novel primarily came from two different sources: a place and a paper. Within the book, the hero works in a skybridge office in lower Manhattan, inspired by the author&#8217;s fascination with skybridges in lower Manhattan and his former office in Chelsea. As for the overall plot, much of the novel is inspired by a 2016 research paper discussing the potential of smart contracts and authenticated data feeds (oracles) for criminal cases [2]. Although at the time, much of the technology discussed in the book seemed to be several decades away, with the advent of ChatGPT and other Large Language Models (LLM) over the past year, the systems described within the book have become much more technically plausible. Thus, the timing of &#8220;The Oracle&#8221; as a cautionary tale could not be more well-placed.</p><h1>Themes and Concepts in &#8220;The Oracle&#8221;</h1><p>As a novel, &#8220;The Oracle&#8221; is unique in its blend of historical references, magical realism, and modern blockchain technologies &#8211; a combination that stems from Ari Juels&#8217; diverse interests and hobbies. Despite being a Computer Science professor at Cornell Tech, the author has always considered himself to have a dual personality, double majoring in Mathematics and Latin Literature. Although throughout his career, Juels has pursued the more mathematical and computer science of his background, &#8220;The Oracle&#8221; is a project that brings together both sides of his personality. Indeed, the book touches upon many different themes and disciplines, from Greek mythology to art trafficking to blockchains, and the process of bringing all these elements together in a plot has been itself a process of exploration and discovery for the author &#8211; half-planned, half-serendipity, allowing the story to grow in a natural direction of its own amongst the interleaving of the various themes and ideas.</p><p>The core concept of the novel centers around a &#8220;rogue smart contract,&#8221; a special type of &#8220;smart contract&#8221; code deployed on a blockchain network with an explicit purpose to solicit crime. In the context of the novel, the crime is the attempted murder of a blockchain developer who is claimed to have defiled the Greek god Apollo [3]. While today, we see many cases of &#8220;rogue smart contracts&#8221; in the wider sense of the term, typically used to conduct financial fraud and manipulation, &#8220;rogue smart contracts&#8221; of the type mentioned in &#8220;The Oracle&#8221; are not possible with current blockchain infrastructure. In this regard, the novel stands as an important cautionary tale about the future.</p><p>As mentioned within the book, the process of the criminal &#8220;rogue smart contract&#8221; is roughly as follows [4]:</p><ol><li><p>The smart contract is activated, with a bounty target on a certain individual</p></li><li><p>Someone commits the crime, and submits an early &#8220;private&#8221; summary of what happened in sealed in a &#8220;cryptographically signed envelope&#8221; &#8211; this is called a &#8220;calling card&#8221;</p></li><li><p>News reports of this crime occur later, containing a &#8220;public&#8221; summary of what happened</p></li><li><p>The agent &#8220;unseals&#8221; the cryptographic envelope, and gives the results to a &#8220;blockchain oracle,&#8221; which judges whether the &#8220;calling card&#8221; matches the &#8220;public&#8221; summary.</p></li><li><p>If there is a match, this means the agent pre-empted the news articles, sufficiently proving that they committed the act. The oracle then sends a message to the smart contract to unlock the bounty.</p></li></ol><p>Previously, the reason why it seemed as if this technology was years or decades away was because of step (4), that required matching the private and public summaries, as for a single event there are infinite ways of reporting it. Yet, with the advance of ChatGPT and other advanced AI systems, this no longer seems so far-fetched, and the central concept itself within the novel now seems much more technically plausible.</p><p>Interestingly, the victim and hero of the plot seems to bear many resemblances to Ari Juels himself &#8211; such as specializing in the development of blockchain oracles, working in New York and loving chocolates. Yet, he remains unnamed throughout the novel. When asked, the author claimed that this is intentional. The character himself &#8220;refused to be named,&#8221; as doing so would decrease his ability to identify with the hero in the novel &#8211; an act of anonymity that brings to mind the origin myth of Bitcoin and its pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto.</p><h1>Reflections on Wider Significance</h1><p>As a landmark work of fiction that combines the cutting-edge technology in the crypto space with the accessibility and attraction of a thriller novel, &#8220;The Oracle&#8221; is far more than just a hobby project for Ari Juels, but rather a work with significant educational, moral, and philosophical messages. Novels such as &#8220;The Oracle&#8221; are in many ways excellent mediums to impart &#8220;fresh and blood&#8221; ideas to people, serving as a gentle introduction to the unique challenges and opportunities that blockchains bring &#8211; not just technologically, but also morally and philosophically.</p><p>The nascent crypto industry today already stands at an over $2 trillion dollar market capitalization [5], and blockchain technology is poised to play a growing role in the way we interact and conduct business internationally. Yet, there is still a large stigma attached to the public perception of the industry &#8211; one perpetuated by debacles such as the FTX fraud case. What &#8220;The Oracle&#8221; represents, in effect, is a unique bridge to allow the industry to reach a much broader audience, and allow people to imagine a technologically plausible future where blockchains pose pressing social, moral, and philosophical questions of life and death.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3be7bc1a-09c8-42f0-8810-8d82e6bf2298_800x994.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="744.2575" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3be7bc1a-09c8-42f0-8810-8d82e6bf2298_800x994.png" width="599" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p><em>Remember Uncle August, The Unhappy Inventor (1919) by George Grosz, showing a scientist confused and disillusioned by the use of his inventions in the massacres of World War I. Image source [6].</em></p><p>Amongst these, perhaps one of the most important questions is how to manage the relationship between the &#8220;inventor&#8221; and the &#8220;invention&#8221;. In Mary Shelley&#8217;s &#8220;Frankenstein,&#8221; for example, Victor the inventor grows to hate his creation, Frankenstein, a monster which goes on to threaten other people as well as Victor himself [7]. This cautionary tale raises the question: should the inventor of a groundbreaking technology be held accountable to all the social effects of his invention, even those that they did not anticipate?&nbsp;</p><p>Ari Juels reprises this Frankensteinian theme within &#8220;The Oracle,&#8221; as the protagonist, a blockchain developer focusing on oracles and privacy solutions, becomes threatened by an agent that uses these very technologies that he develops. For Juels himself, this is a very personal topic, since his research group pre-empted the concept behind what is now known as Maximal Extractive Value (MEV), coauthoring a seminal paper describing how transaction ordering can be manipulated for profit in DeFi (Decentralized Finance) applications [8]. Instead of establishing sufficient guardrails against these practices, this feature eventually became heavily exploited, undermining key principles of trustless, decentralized applications.&nbsp;</p><p>Cases like these, where genuine innovation ends up backfiring and becomes relegated for profit, may contribute to the general public&#8217;s overall perception of crypto as a wild, &#8220;dark-forest&#8221; like industry filled with fraudulent actors. Going forward, to prevent more cases of innovation from backfiring, it may be necessary to establish more comprehensive guidelines &#8211; whether regulatory rulings or industry norms &#8211; for responsible disclosure, thus allowing the blockchain space to be more inline with traditional cryptographic and computer security standards.&nbsp;</p><p>Indeed, one of &#8220;The Oracle&#8221;&#8217;s goals is to present a more comprehensive account of the blockchain industry&#8217;s significance, introducing to a new audience how this industry represents a new frontier of cutting-edge interdisciplinary research. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), for example, which govern major Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols such as Uniswap, Compound, and Aave, blends together innovation in technological, financial, and sociopolitical research to innovate new forms of socioeconomic organization [9]. In many ways, the blockchain space&#8217;s potential is much like that of the early Internet, where underneath the financial speculation of the space there is a wealth of technological innovation that can dramatically impact the way we lead our ordinary lives.</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>In a space where unbiased, relevant, and pertinent information is inaccessible to the general public, &#8220;The Oracle&#8221; stands out as a groundbreaking work that combines a riveting thriller narrative with profound philosophical reflections on the future of the blockchain space. As blockchain technology continues to mature and onboard more and more everyday users, works such as &#8220;The Oracle&#8221; may prove crucial to understanding the crypto space and the questions that it brings.</p><p>So will Ari Juels bring us a sequel? Perhaps only time will tell.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Thanks for reading the Stanford Blockchain Review!

Where did the complexity of a seemingly simple idea come from?</p><p>In this article, we will take you through the <em><strong>evolution</strong></em> of the protocol, by covering how EigenLayer's current complex architecture emerged from the initial concept. The target audience for this post is individuals who have some experience with smart contracts and have heard of EigenLayer and restaking {1}.</p><p>Now, let's dive in.</p><h1>EigenLayer&#8217;s Goal: Making Building Infrastructure Easy</h1><p>First, let's preface with the problem EigenLayer is trying to solve. If you are already familiar with this part, move to later sections.</p><p>Developers who build decentralized infrastructures on Ethereum face the challenge of establishing their own economic security. While Ethereum provides economic security for smart contract protocols, <em><strong>infrastructures like bridges or sequencers require their own economic security</strong></em> to enable a distributed network of nodes to reach consensus.</p><p>Consensus mechanisms are essential for facilitating interactions among these nodes, whether it's an L1, an oracle network, or a bridge. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work">Proof of work</a> is energy-intensive, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_authority">proof of authority</a> is overly centralized, and as a result, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_stake">proof of stake</a> (PoS) has emerged as the prevailing consensus mechanism for most infrastructure projects.</p><p>However, bootstrapping a new PoS network is hard, for the following reasons:</p><ol><li><p>It is difficult to identify where the stakers (people who provide stake) are located. There is no single place where developers can find stakers.</p></li><li><p>Stakers must invest a significant amount of money to obtain a stake in the new network, usually by buying the network's native token, which is generally volatile and hard to get.</p></li><li><p>Stakers must forgo other rewards opportunities, such as the 5% rewards offered by Ethereum.</p></li><li><p>The current security model is undesirable as the cost to corrupt any dApp is simply the cost needed to compromise its weakest infrastructural dependency {2}.</p></li></ol><p>EigenLayer was created to address these issues. Specifically, as a solution to achieve these four key objectives:</p><blockquote><p>A. It serves as a platform connecting stakers and infrastructure developers.</p><p>B. Stakers can offer economic security using any token.</p><p>C. Stakers have the option to restake their stake and contribute to the security of other infrastructures while earning native ETH rewards.</p><p>D. Through restaking, EigenLayer pools security instead of fragmenting it.</p></blockquote><p>Thus, EigenLayer creates an infrastructure layer that generalizes the concept of providing economic security.</p><h1>Initial Design for EigenLayer</h1><p>We'll start with the simplest design: a staker stakes tokens into a contract, which includes a function that allows for the slashing of the staker's tokens if a proof is submitted and meets the criteria. The user can then withdraw their balance.</p><p>Other stakers can also stake into this contract, adding to the security of the infrastructure. We'll refer to this contract as TokenPool.</p><p>To provide some clarity, here are some definitions for the terms used in this article:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Staker</strong>: anyone who provides tokens into EigenLayer.</p></li><li><p><strong>Token</strong>: any kind of token; for simplicity, think of an ERC20 token for now.</p></li><li><p><strong>TokenPool</strong>: a smart contract that holds the stakers' tokens.</p></li><li><p><strong>Slashing</strong>: removing the staker's access to their staked tokens.</p></li></ul><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08ae51a3-ff59-497c-ac7c-c3fc0f2c72f7_717x257.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="257" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08ae51a3-ff59-497c-ac7c-c3fc0f2c72f7_717x257.png" width="717" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>The interface of this TokenPool can be represented as the following:</p><pre><code>contract TokenPool {

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mapping(address =&gt; uint256) public balance;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;function stake(uint256 amount) public;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;function withdraw() public;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;function slash(address staker, ??? proof) public;

}</code></pre><p>Does this fulfill the requirement for any staker to provide stake for any infrastructure? Yes!</p><ol><li><p>Staker can pledge stake to a specific commitment (defined in the slash function)</p></li><li><p>Slashed if found malicious (breaks from the commitment).</p></li><li><p>Withdraw from the system.</p></li></ol><p>This simple design fulfills Goal (A) of connecting stakers and infrastructures. 1/4 so far:</p><blockquote><p>A. It serves as a platform connecting stakers and infrastructure developers. &#9989;</p><p>B. Stakers can offer economic security using any token. &#10060;</p><p>C. Stakers have the option to restake their stake and contribute to the security of other infrastructures while earning native ETH rewards. &#10060;</p><p>D. Through restaking, EigenLayer pools security instead of fragmenting it. &#10060;</p></blockquote><h1>Liquid Staking: Reduce Opportunity Cost for Stakers</h1><p>When new infrastructure protocols launch, they typically introduce a new, native token, and it can be challenging to convince stakers to hold onto this token, since (1) the native token's value can fluctuate significantly, making it difficult to persuade stakers to acquire it, and (2) there is competition from other protocols offering higher rewards rates, which makes it necessary for the protocol to provide compelling incentives to attract stakers.</p><p>EigenLayer addresses these challenges by allowing stakers to stake any token and earn multiple rewards simultaneously. Since EigenLayer operates on the Ethereum network, we can leverage existing Ethereum primitives to achieve this.</p><p>One approach is to enable stakers to provide stake in a <strong>liquid staking token</strong> (LST). By using LST, stakers can retain their native ETH rewards while securing other infrastructures and potentially earning additional rewards. With this, we&#8217;ve managed to achieve goal (B) and (C).</p><blockquote><p>A. It serves as a platform connecting stakers and infrastructure developers. &#9989;</p><p>B. Stakers can offer economic security using any token. &#9989;</p><p>C. Stakers have the option to restake their stake and contribute to the security of other infrastructures while earning native ETH rewards. &#9989;</p><p>D. Through restaking, EigenLayer pools security instead of fragmenting it. &#10060;</p></blockquote><h1>Implementing Pool Security</h1><p>EigenLayer's final goal is to address the issue of fragmented security. Currently, if an application's security relies on multiple infrastructure dependencies, a single economically compromised dependency can threaten the entire application's security. This problem becomes worse when the economic security of these dependencies is isolated. These isolated points form economic "honey pots" that attract potential attacks.</p><p>Therefore, instead of maintaining several separate economic security pools for different infrastructures, it would be beneficial to consolidate these security measures. Doing so could progressively improve the economic security of all dependencies at once.</p><p><strong>In the EigenLayer context, each infrastructure service built using this restaking framework is referred to as an Actively Validated Service (AVS). </strong>As it is, each TokenPool has its own unique slashing condition <strong>embedded within</strong> the contract. This implies that for each AVS, a separate TokenPool contract needs to be coded. If a staker wishes to participate in two AVSs simultaneously, they would need a new TokenPool. This new pool must <strong>incorporate</strong> the slash functions from both AVSs. If two slashing conditions can simultaneously slash a staker, the staker is making two credible commitments at the same time.</p><p>A more <strong>efficient</strong> approach would allow the staker to participate in different AVSs without the need to create new TokenPool contracts or modify the slash function. This can be accomplished by relocating the slash function into a different contract, termed the "<strong>slasher</strong>". Here is how they would interact:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6801011b-0b51-4cc8-820d-22bc0f3ed4da_1600x475.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="432" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6801011b-0b51-4cc8-820d-22bc0f3ed4da_1600x475.png" width="1456" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p><em>Intermediate EigenLayer design after separating the slashing from the token pools.</em></p><p>The new interface for the TokenPool would look like this. (slash is no longer there.)</p><pre><code>contract TokenPool {

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mapping(address =&gt; uint256) public balance;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mapping(address =&gt; address[]) public slasher;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;function stake(uint256 amount) public;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;function withdraw() public;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;function enroll(address slasher) onlyOwner;

}</code></pre><p>We still maintain the stake, withdraw, and balance functions and variables. In addition to these, we've introduced a new function and a new variable. The variable, slasher, monitors each staker's currently enrolled AVSs. The function, enroll, allows a staker to participate in AVSs.</p><p>Enrolling into an AVS therefore is giving a slasher the ability to slash your stake. The enroll function is access controlled here because it could potentially enable anyone to enroll into any slasher contract. To ensure that this TokenPool is managed securely, we will assume that it is overseen by a trusted third-party.</p><p>With this modification, after staking into the TokenPool, a staker can join a specific AVS by calling the enroll function. This function will incorporate the AVS-specific slasher contract into the slasher mapping.</p><p>During the withdrawal process, the TokenPool contract can ask each slasher to determine if the staker is eligible to withdraw. This verification is done using the isSlashed function in the slasher contract. If isSlashed for this staker is TRUE, the staker cannot withdraw their stakes as they have been slashed.</p><pre><code>contract slasher {

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mapping(address =&gt; bool) public isSlashed;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;function slash(address staker, ??? proof) public;

}</code></pre><p>The slash function contains the slashing logic for each AVS. While the slashing logic might differ across various AVSs, upon successful execution of the slash function, the function will set the isSlashed variable to true for the questioned staker.</p><blockquote><p>A. It serves as a platform connecting stakers and infrastructure developers. &#9989;</p><p>B. Stakers can offer economic security using any token. &#9989;</p><p>C. Stakers have the option to restake their stake and contribute to the security of other infrastructures while earning native ETH rewards. &#9989;</p><p>D. Through restaking, EigenLayer pools security instead of fragmenting it. &#9989;</p></blockquote><p><strong>With pooled security implemented, we have created the minimum viable EigenLayer!</strong> The minimum viable version acts as a platform connecting stakers and AVS developers. Stakers can now stake any token without compromising other rewards, while AVS developers can utilize the shared security pool to safeguard various types of new infrastructure applications.</p><p>In the upcoming section, we will improve the minimum viable version to accommodate additional use cases and make EigenLayer future proof.</p><h1>Design Extension: Staker doesn't have to operate</h1><p>In the minimum viable design, stakers can stake tokens for various AVSs. However, some stakers may not have the capability or desire to personally handle the operations that secure the AVS. This is similar to <strong>ETH</strong> holders who may prefer <strong>not to</strong> operate their own <strong>validators</strong>.</p><p>Our goal is to <strong>distinguish</strong> between these two roles. <strong>Stakers</strong> provide tokens for the economic security of each AVS, while <strong>operators</strong> are individuals who run software to ensure the operational security of each AVS.</p><p>We can make a <strong>slight</strong> adjustment to the TokenPool contract to include a delegation process. This allows a staker's token balance to be represented by the operator they delegate to. However, if the operator violates the AVS commitment, the staker's tokens will be slashed.</p><pre><code>contract TokenPool {

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mapping(address =&gt; uint256) public stakerBalance;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mapping(address =&gt; uint256) public operatorBalance;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mapping(address =&gt; address) public delegation;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mapping(address =&gt; address[]) public slasher;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;function stake(uint256 amount) public;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;function withdraw() public;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;function delegateTo(address operator) public;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;function enroll(address slasher) operatorOnly;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;function exit(address slasher) operatorOnly;

}</code></pre><p>We've divided the balance variable into <strong>two distinct parts</strong>: one for the operator and one for the staker. Additionally, we've introduced a delegation mapping to record the delegation relationships between stakers and operators.</p><p>We've also made a minor modification to the slasher mapping. Now, it gives the slasher contract the authority to slash the operators instead of the stakers.</p><pre><code>contract slasher {

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mapping(address =&gt; bool) public isSlashed;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;function slash(address operator, ??? proof) public;

}</code></pre><p>In terms of functions, we've incorporated delegateTo, enabling stakers to delegate their tokens to operators. The enroll function has been redesigned to be operator-specific, allowing the operator to enroll in different AVSs, rather than the stakers.</p><p>During the withdraw process, the contract initially identifies the operator to whom the staker is delegated. It then checks each slasher contract linked to that operator address. If any slasher reports that the operator is slashed, the withdrawal process is immediately halted.</p><h2>Maintaining staker autonomy</h2><p>If the operator is the only one who can opt into AVSs, how can stakers decide which AVSs they want their stake to secure? When a staker is also an operator and self-delegates their stake, they maintain full control over the AVS they operate. But what if a staker can't run it on their own and requires another operator to manage these services? Doesn't this give the operator total control over AVS selection?</p><p>We can allow the staker to select the AVS through a simple workaround. The operator can maintain different addresses for various AVS combinations. <strong>Each address represents a potential combination</strong> of AVSs supported by the operator.</p><p>For instance, if an operator supports two AVSs, they can have three addresses: one for AVS 1, another for AVS 2, and a third for running both. If a staker trusts the operator and only wants to secure AVS 1, they can delegate to the appropriate operator's address.</p><p>Through this method, we enable stakers to fully control their stake. At the same time, they can delegate off-chain responsibilities to operators.</p><h2>Modularizing the operator</h2><p>The TokenPool contract is quite bulky right now. We will take the operator-specific functions from the TokenPool and put it into a separate contract, DelegationManager.</p><p>Now, the TokenPool contract would look like the following:</p><pre><code>contract TokenPool {

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mapping(address =&gt; uint256) public stakerBalance;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;function stake(uint256 amount) public;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;function withdraw() public;

}</code></pre><p>The TokenPool contract will only track the balance of each staker. The tracking of AVS and enrolling will be handled by the DelegationManager.</p><pre><code>contract DelegationManager {

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mapping(address =&gt; uint256) public operatorBalance;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mapping(address =&gt; address) public delegation;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mapping(address =&gt; address[]) public slasher;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;function delegateTo(address operator) public;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;function enroll(address slasher) operatorOnly;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;function exit(address slasher) operatorOnly;

}</code></pre><p>Lastly, the slasher contract remains unchanged. It tracks which operator is slashed at the current time for each AVS.</p><pre><code>contract slasher {

The TokenManager then invokes the stake function of the relevant TokenPool associated with that token. The user's tokens are transferred to the TokenPool. By the end of the function, totalShares and stakerPoolShares are updated to reflect the new stake. totalShares keeps track of the total number of shares issued by the TokenPool, while stakerPoolShares records the number of shares held by each individual staker in each TokenPool.</p><p>The interface for each contract would look like this.</p><pre><code>contract TokenManager {

}</code></pre><p>Now, under the same core architecture, stakers can stake any token into EigenLayer to secure other AVSs.</p><h1>Design Extension: Expand AVS designs</h1><p><strong>Consider the following situation</strong>: a staker withdraws their stakes <strong>right after</strong> engaging in slashable behavior, <strong>but before</strong> others can slash their assets.</p><p><em>For example</em>, let's say there's an operator who is also a staker, and they act maliciously in an AVS. Before anyone else can slash on-chain, the operator withdraws their stake from the EigenLayer contracts. This is possible because, at the time of withdrawal, the slasher has not yet been updated to slash their assets. Consequently, the AVS can no longer slash the malicious operator/staker since there are no more tokens to slash with.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8df7f8e5-ffdb-4f73-9c69-a1c7ced6ded0_1355x516.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="516" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8df7f8e5-ffdb-4f73-9c69-a1c7ced6ded0_1355x516.png" width="1355" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p><em>A potential timeline of event for a malicious operator/staker.</em></p><p>Therefore, an AVS that is "safe" would need a slashing contract capable of freezing malicious operators in the <strong>same block</strong> where the incident occurred. This limitation greatly restricts AVS designs, <strong>rendering most of them unsafe.</strong></p><p>One solution is to incorporate an <strong>unbonding period</strong>. Instead of enabling stakers to instantly withdraw their stake, we introduce a <strong>delay</strong> in the withdrawal process known as the unbonding period. After which, the staker can withdraw like before.</p><p>When a staker decides to withdraw from the system, their request is placed in a <strong>queue</strong>. This queued withdrawal is only processed after the operator's longest unbonding period has <strong>expired</strong>. This is because an operator may manage multiple AVSs, but a staker's withdrawal can only align with one unbonding period. For security reasons, <strong>the system sets the unbonding period to the longest one.</strong></p><p>For example, if a staker delegates their stake to an operator participating in three AVSs with unbonding periods of six, five, and seven days, they must wait seven days after requesting a withdrawal from EigenLayer to access their stakes. This is because seven days is the longest of the three periods.</p><p>After the seven-day period concludes, the staker can <strong>withdraw</strong> their stakes. However, if the operator to whom they delegated becomes <strong>slashed</strong> during this time, the pending withdrawal will be <strong>stopped</strong> as well.</p><p>To incorporate this change, the DelegationManager would need to track this unbonding period for each operator and update it <strong>whenever the operator enrolls into a new AVS</strong>.</p><pre><code>contract DelegationManager {

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// ...

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mapping(address =&gt; uint256) public unbondingPeriod;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// ...

}</code></pre><p>After tracking the unbonding period for each operator, we will also incorporate this value into the staker withdraw process. <strong>The withdraw process consists of two steps</strong>:</p><ol><li><p>Stakers queue a withdrawal.</p></li><li><p>After the unbonding period has passed, the staker can complete their withdrawal.</p></li></ol><p>The updated interface would look like the following:</p><pre><code>contract TokenManager {

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mapping(address =&gt; address) public tokenPoolRegistry;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mapping(address =&gt; mapping(address =&gt; uint256)) public 
         stakerPoolShares;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mapping(address =&gt; uint256) public withdrawalCompleteTime;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;function stakeToPool(address pool, uint256 amount) public;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;function queueWithdrawal(address pool) public;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;function completeWithdrawal(address pool) public;

}</code></pre><p>When a staker queues a withdrawal, the TokenManager will verify with DelegationManager whether the staker's delegated operator is slashed. If the operator is not slashed, the TokenManager will update the staker's withdrawalCompleteTime according to the unbondingPeriod from the DelegationManager and the current time.</p><p>After the unbonding period, the staker can finalize its withdrawal through completeWithdrawal. The function will verify if the withdrawalCompleteTime has passed. If it has, the staker's token will be transferred out following the same process as before {3}.</p><h2>Modularize the slashers</h2><p>Since we are making the slashing mechanism safe, let's also try to make it more modular and efficient.</p><p>Currently, during the withdrawal process, TokenManager would need to check with each individual slasher to see if the operator is slashed. <strong>This adds gas overhead to stakers and could significantly lower the rewards for smaller stakers.</strong></p><p>Moreover, as AVS developers typically design slashers, modularizing this particular component could simplify the development process for individual AVSs.</p><p>Like the TokenManager, we will utilize a two-part design for the slashing mechanism. SlasherManager maintains the status of each operator. Individual slasher will handle the slashing logic for each AVS.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc9a89a5a-2c98-4b01-b04e-8db0ea8e0aae_1487x437.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="428" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc9a89a5a-2c98-4b01-b04e-8db0ea8e0aae_1487x437.png" width="1456" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p><em>Modularize the slashing contract even more to reduce staker gas cost.</em></p><pre><code>contract SlasherManager {

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;function exitAVS(address slasher) operatorOnly;

}</code></pre><p>The SlasherManager allows an operator to enroll in an AVS by adding the AVS slasher contract as one of the slashers capable of slashing the operator. This permission of "who can slash who" is tracked by the canSlash variable.</p><pre><code>contract slasher {

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;function slash(address operator, ??? proof) public;

}</code></pre><p>The slasher will be AVS-specific and most-likely be developed by the AVS developers.

Connect stakers and infrastructure developers through a platform.</p><p>B. Allow stakers to provide economic security using any token.</p><p>C. Enable stakers to restake their stake and earn native ETH rewards while contributing to the security of other infrastructures.</p><p>D. Pool security through restaking instead of fragmenting it.</p></blockquote><p>After <em><strong>several</strong></em> iterations, we developed three core components: TokenManager, DelegationManager, and SlasherManager.

In this essay, Danny Yang, the founder of OnChainMonkey, presents Ordinals&#8217; impact on the Bitcoin NFT ecosystem, explores how OnChainMonkey leverages features of Ordinals&#8217; programmability to reimagine the concept of a digital asset on Bitcoin, and discusses future directions in the Bitcoin NFT space.</em></p><h1>Ordinals: Enabling Digital Artifacts On Bitcoin</h1><p>Introduced in early 2023, the Ordinals protocol arrived at a pivotal moment for Bitcoin, which had been experiencing low transaction fees due to decreased demand. This was a critical development since Bitcoin's renowned security is funded by miner revenues from these fees and block rewards. With block rewards expected to halve by April 2024, thereby impacting miner income significantly, the need for a new growth driver was evident. Ordinals fulfilled this role effectively, stimulating a significant increase in transaction demand. Over $200 million in transaction fees has been spent so far for creating inscriptions, a type of transaction unique to Ordinals [1].</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e619520-de04-42b6-bb53-6b4abd5b674b_1356x784.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="784" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e619520-de04-42b6-bb53-6b4abd5b674b_1356x784.png" width="1356" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Source: <a href="https://dune.com/dgtl_assets/bitcoin-ordinals-analysis">https://dune.com/dgtl_assets/bitcoin-ordinals-analysis</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>Although NFTs have existed on Bitcoin for years before ERC-721 (such as Spells of Genesis and Rare Pepes trading cards) [2], the Bitcoin NFT market has been dwarfed by those on other blockchains like Ethereum and Solana. Now, however, because of Ordinals, the Bitcoin NFT market is rapidly catching up to the top NFT markets on all the other blockchains [3]. NFTs using Ordinals differentiate from almost all other NFTs because the Ordinals protocol treats Bitcoin as a medium for the NFT, as opposed to the usual certificate model for NFTs. Ordinals was launched at a time when the overall NFT market had matured enough to understand this new type of on-chain NFT that used the blockchain as a medium.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9deff630-0fb8-4698-8fac-b71204cc80b1_1074x796.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="796" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9deff630-0fb8-4698-8fac-b71204cc80b1_1074x796.png" width="1074" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">The Emergence of Bitcoin Ordinals Volume Relative To Other Chains, accessed Jan 27, 2024.

This numbering allows for the tracking of each individual satoshi through Bitcoin transactions. Ownership of a satoshi is determined by the Bitcoin ledger.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Inscription: The Ordinal Protocol enables data to be written on-chain on the Bitcoin blockchain. The data asset is called an Inscription.</p></li><li><p>Mapping of ownership: The Ordinal Protocol links the ownership of an Inscription to a unique satoshi. Thus, ownership of the satoshi equates to ownership of the inscription.&nbsp;</p></li></ol><p>Through this design, Ordinals NFTs on Bitcoin inherit BItcoin&#8217;s security properties, becoming a permanent record on the oldest, most decentralized, most secure, and highest value blockchain. Just like the founding principles of Bitcoin itself, the Ordinals protocol is permissionless, uncensorable, immutable, and complete. Permissionless means that we have the right to transfer the NFT to whoever we want without needing anyone else&#8217;s permission. Uncensorable means that no other party can censor our NFT. Immutable means that the NFT cannot be altered. And complete means that the NFT is complete on the medium it was created on, Bitcoin (i.e. on-chain). The NFT that satisfies all these properties is a Digital Artifact.</p><h1>The Rise of OnChainMonkey (OCM)</h1><p>Ordinals, however, is more than just a protocol. Just like Bitcoin, the community that formed around Ordinals is indispensable to the protocol&#8217;s rise. And this is the community that I&#8217;ve tried to cultivate, from beginning the Stanford Bitcoin Meetup in 2013, to establishing OnChainMonkey (OCM) as one of the most notable Bitcoin Ordinals project.</p><p>OCM, initially launched in 2021 as an art project on Ethereum, was an innovative blend of simplicity and complexity. I detailed its creation in "<a href="https://onchainmonkey.medium.com/the-making-of-onchain-monkey-98aa04fb6f6">The Making of OnChain Monkey</a>," also known as OCM Genesis [5]. The art of OCM stood out due to its unique design coupled with the intricacy of its on-chain transaction. Remarkably, all 10,000 distinctive monkeys were minted in a single Ethereum transaction. This singular transactional approach was a crucial aspect of OCM's artistic identity.</p><p>Then, in February 2023, the entire collection of 10,000 OCM Genesis images and their metadata were inscribed onto the Bitcoin blockchain as Inscription 20219. This inscription number is significant: being the 20,219th inscription on Bitcoin, it coincidentally mirrors the original creation date of the collection on Ethereum - September 2021 (year 2021, month 9). This marked the first occasion when such a large collection of images, specifically 10,000, was recorded and secured on Bitcoin.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3a645068-19ce-472a-9758-ce519c1cee1d_1600x860.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="783" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3a645068-19ce-472a-9758-ce519c1cee1d_1600x860.png" width="1456" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">OCM Genesis on Bitcoin. Source: <a href="https://magiceden.io/ordinals/marketplace/ocm-genesis">https://magiceden.io/ordinals/marketplace/ocm-genesis</a>&nbsp;</figcaption></figure></div><p>What stands out in this process, mirroring the original 2021 event, is the efficiency of the inscription method. Utilizing a single inscription for the entire collection meant that OCM leveraged the blockchain medium - a communal resource - with utmost efficiency. Impressively, the transaction that recorded all 10,000 OCM images consumed less than 20 kilobytes of Bitcoin block space, averaging less than 2 bytes per image. This approach ensured that the transaction did not overburden the Bitcoin network. As Bitcoin's usage expands, the efficient utilization of its block space, exemplified by OCM's creation method, will become increasingly important for all Bitcoin users.</p><p>OCM's core values are encapsulated in the acronym !RISE - Respect, Integrity, Sustainability, and Enrichment. The significance of 'On-Chain' to OCM is due to the superior security offered by blockchain for digital assets. With the advent of Ordinals in early 2023, OCM's shift to this new protocol for on-chain assets on Bitcoin was a strategic move. Although initially met with skepticism, our team's unique experience in both Bitcoin since 2013 and recent years' development of NFTs and digital artifacts reinforced our confidence in this transition. We foresaw the necessity of higher Bitcoin fees in the future and dedicated efforts to grow both the OCM and Ordinals communities, and in doing so, moving the NFT community forward towards a more secure, decentralized, and transparent system aligned with the original principles of Bitcoin.</p><h1>Highlighting Ordinals&#8217; Capabilities Through OCM</h1><p>One of our main focuses has been on elucidating the significance of Ordinals and demonstrating optimal usage of the Bitcoin medium. This includes illustrating a variety of Ordinals programmability features, including Recursive Inscriptions, Parent-Child Provenance, and Reinscription.</p><h4><strong>1. Generative and Recursive Inscriptions on Bitcoin</strong></h4><p>One of the great powers of Ordinals is the ability to inscribe code on Bitcoin. This functionality allows for programming directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. This very feature enabled us to efficiently create 10,000 images on-chain for OCM. By inscribing a piece of code capable of generating 10,000 SVG image files for the OCM collection, we accomplished this feat in a single inscription.</p><p>Another advantage of using code is its ability to invoke other code. OCM was at the forefront of employing a method called Recursive Inscriptions, where inscribed code calls upon other inscribed code. Inscription 20219 stands as one of the first instances of such recursive inscriptions. The code within 20219 can be utilized in other inscriptions to access each individual OCM image. This concept of Recursive Inscriptions and the broader application of code will become increasingly vital as Bitcoin continues to grow. Through Recursive Inscriptions, all previously inscribed code on Bitcoin becomes a resource for future developers. For instance, when we developed <a href="https://onchainmonkey.medium.com/ocm-dimensions-unveiling-the-many-dimensions-of-bitcoin-ordinals-c850688db68e">&nbsp;OCM Dimensions</a>, we were the first to inscribe JavaScript libraries such as compression, Three.js, and p5.js. These libraries are now increasingly employed by creators on Bitcoin to develop new and innovative applications. We also provide <a href="https://github.com/metagood/OCM-Dimensions">tutorials and tools</a> for using these popular generative art libraries on Bitcoin.</p><p>As Bitcoin fees rise, the generative coding approach will be critical in keeping inscriptions from being cost prohibitive. We saw Bitcoin fees go up by a factor of more than a hundred times in 2023 because of the early growth of Ordinals and increased usage of Bitcoin&#8217;s block space. Today, inscribing a single image can cost over $10,000! The reason we inscribed OCM Genesis in the generative approach was to show how much could be done on Bitcoin using minimum bytes and fees. Remarkably, 10,000 images of OCM Genesis were inscribed for just a couple of dollars.</p><h4><strong>2. Parent-Child Provenance For Digital Artifacts</strong></h4><p>A key advantage of using NFTs is their ability to establish provenance, and Ordinals introduces a powerful feature known as Parent-Child Provenance [4]. This feature facilitates the tracing of the origin of "child" inscriptions by linking them back to a "parent" inscription. For instance, in creating an NFT collection on Bitcoin, one can establish a Parent inscription using Parent-Child Provenance, from which numerous Child inscriptions comprising the collection can be inscribed.</p><p>When Inscription 20219 was created, it served as the Parent inscription for the OCM Genesis collection. At that time, the concepts of both Parent-Child Provenance and Recursive Inscriptions were novel, leading to some misunderstanding about the rationale behind inscribing an entire collection's assets in a single inscription. However, OCM Genesis emerged as the trailblazing collection demonstrating the use of Parent-Child Provenance in distributing a 10k collection. Moreover, OCM optimized this distribution with Recursive Inscriptions, setting a precedent in efficiency.</p><p>Parent-Child Provenance allows for the tracking of ownership transition from the collective "Parent" (the original inscription of 10,000 OCMs) to the individual "Children" (each separate OCM owned by different individuals). Recursive Inscriptions, meanwhile, help to demonstrate that each child inscription is responsible for distributing one of the 10,000 individual elements of the OCM digital artifact contained in the Parent inscription [4].</p><p>This process allows for the creation of digital artifacts on Bitcoin. Consider Inscription 20219, a digital artifact containing 10,000 unique OCM (OnChainMonkeys). This collection fulfills all the criteria of a digital artifact: it's complete, ownable, uncensorable, permissionless, and immutable.</p><p>Initially, the entire 10k OCM collection was owned by a single entity. This is akin to a car manufacturer like Bugatti producing 10,000 cars and owning them all at first. Once Bugatti sells and delivers a car, complete with its title and keys, to a buyer, that buyer becomes the new owner of the car. Similarly, in the case of Inscription 20219, each of the 10,000 OCMs is set to be transferred to individual owners. This process is facilitated through the use of Parent-Child Provenance and Recursive Inscriptions.</p><h4><strong>3. Saving Fees with Batch Inscriptions</strong></h4><p>An efficient method for creating on-chain records is through Batch Inscriptions, which can be effectively paired with Parent-Child Provenance for distributing multiple NFTs in one go. This approach significantly reduces both the transaction fees and the time (or the number of Bitcoin blocks) required for inscription completion.</p><p>For instance, when we applied Batch Inscriptions to the OCM Genesis collection, the process of inscribing the entire 10k collection became 250 times faster compared to a scenario where Batch Inscriptions weren't used. This efficiency in batching not only streamlines the inscription process but also optimizes the overall resource utilization on the blockchain.</p><h4><strong>4. Rare and Exotic Satoshis, A Unique Feature of Ordinals</strong></h4><p>Ordinal theory meticulously tracks each satoshi (sat) in Bitcoin, including those from historic blocks like Block 9, mined by Satoshi Nakamoto himself. Particularly notable are the first-ever Bitcoin transaction sats, known as 450x sats, mined in Block 9 and sent by Satoshi to Hal Finney. These 450x sats, starting with the digits 450, are highly sought after by sat hunters for their historical value and collectibility, making them ideal for inscribing art on Bitcoin.</p><p>In the Ordinals framework, sats are categorized into different tiers like common, uncommon, rare, epic, legendary, and mythic, according to the Rodarmor Rarity Scale devised by Casey Rodarmor, the creator of Ordinals [6].</p><p>The OCM Genesis collection utilized these historically significant Block 9 - 450x sats. The entire collection of 10,000 children was inscribed on sequential Block 9 sats, where the last five digits of the sat number correspond to the Genesis number. For instance, OCM Genesis #1 is on sat 45017800001 and OCM Genesis #10,000 is on sat 45017810000. This precise matching of sat numbers is not only a testament to the skill required to utilize the Bitcoin medium but also clarifies the provenance and link between the sat and the OCM Genesis art.</p><p>Combining matching sat numbers with generative art opens up new possibilities. In the case of OCM Genesis, the art is generated by the inscribed code on Bitcoin, using the specific sat number, further integrating the Bitcoin medium into the art form.</p><h4><strong>5. Reinscription, the Unexplored Frontier for Programming Bitcoin</strong></h4><p>Reinscription, a feature of Ordinals, allows the same satoshi (sat) to be reinscribed multiple times [4]. The cost for each reinscription is comparable to that of any standard inscription. Importantly, all reinscriptions occur on the same sat, ensuring they are interlinked and transferred collectively. Only the sat's owner has the authority to inscribe or reinscribe it. Reinscriptions are particularly useful in recording state changes, especially with the advent of the Ordinals <a href="https://github.com/ordinals/ord/pull/2680">sat endpoint feature</a>, enabling the development of on-chain programs and applications on Bitcoin [7].</p><p>OCM Genesis utilized this feature to reinscribe multiple 10k collections onto the same sats. These reinscribed collections are effectively "soul-bound," meaning they are permanently connected to the original collection. This connectivity not only facilitates ease of navigation between collections but also enhances the value of the original collection by incorporating additional reinscribed collections. OCM Genesis pioneered this approach with a reinscribed 10k collection. Each sat in OCM Genesis houses four distinct collections, reflecting the innovative use of reinscription in digital art and asset management on the Bitcoin blockchain.</p><h1>Exploring the Future of Digital Assets on Bitcoin</h1><p>Bitcoin's role in securing digital assets beyond its native token is still in its infancy. The infrastructure is under development, but the potential is immense. The success of asset markets on other blockchains like Ethereum and Solana suggests a similar growth trajectory for Bitcoin, propelled by innovations like Ordinals. Works like OCM Genesis showcase the possibilities for future assets within the Bitcoin ecosystem, indicating a promising future for digital assets on this platform.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the most interesting parts of the Ordinals protocol is to reimagine the popular 10k Collection as an Art Form on Bitcoin. The 10k collection has become a significant art form in the world of NFTs, with many collections adopting this format. On Ethereum, creating a collection of 10 or 10,000 is almost equally straightforward. However, on Bitcoin, creating a 10,000-piece collection is exponentially more expensive and complex than a smaller collection. This complexity stems from the need for each NFT to be a distinct, on-chain digital artifact, making each creation cost-intensive and immutable. Any error in a single NFT could necessitate scrapping the entire collection. Techniques like Parent-Child Provenance and sequential sat numbering further complicate the process, increasing the risk of mistakes with larger collections. Therefore, successfully creating a 10k collection on Bitcoin, like OCM Genesis, is a remarkable achievement, highlighting the potential of Bitcoin as a medium for digital art.</p><p>Another avenue that we&#8217;re excited about is the possibility of encoding certificates of ownership on BItcoin &#8211; a process that is very different from that of Ethereum. Ethereum's model involves owning a tradable certificate for a digital item, usually stored off-chain. In contrast, on Bitcoin, the digital item is on-chain, making it directly ownable and tradable. OCM Genesis explores these concepts by transferring ownership from Ethereum to Bitcoin. This involves a teleburn process, where the Ethereum asset is bound to the corresponding Bitcoin Inscription. The Ethereum asset becomes "soul-bound" to the Bitcoin inscription, transferring ownership to whoever holds the Bitcoin Inscription. Additionally, a Certificate of Ownership is inscribed on the same sats, serving as proof of ownership for the teleburned Ethereum asset. This concept is part of the unique artistry of OCM Genesis and represents a step towards securing Real World Assets (RWA) on Bitcoin, potentially encompassing titles, deeds, and securities.</p><p>As we enter 2024 and the second year of the Ordinals protocol, there is still much to explore. We at OCM remain incredibly excited about the future of the space, and remain committed to the road ahead, leading the way to reconceptualize the idea of digital assets on Bitcoin and truly exploring Ordinals as a canvas for digital innovation.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Thanks for reading Stanford Blockchain Review!

Opepen is an NFT project with 16K NFTs broken down into 200 sets, where each set features art from a different artist. The project includes a series of mechanisms that help build community cohesion and allow NFT holders to help decide which artists get selected to do a set. Beyond the NFTs and 200 sets, Opepen has promoted remixing and encouraged artists and community members to participate in Opepen without needing to hold the NFT. In this article, we will discuss what Opepen is and dive deeper into how it mixes art, NFTs and open-source values to scale its project through attention based network effects.</p><h1>Opepen&#8217;s Structure</h1><p>On January 8, 2023, Jack Butcher launched Opepen as an open edition (OE) NFT and a free mint [1]. Following the success of Butcher&#8217;s run with his other NFT project, Checks, many thought Opepen was just a simple free mint. But then on February 19, 2023, Jack tweeted &#8220;Opepfp?&#8221; and lit the fuse to turn Opepen from an OE into something more [2]. Opepen evolved from a 16K Open Edition NFT to a collection of 200 sets with 80 NFTs, where each Set features Opepen art created by different artists. The goal of Opepen is to create a visual framework that is recognizable and encourage others to remix the base image &#8211; both formally and informally.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb4e282b9-21d6-4c26-9476-14bd24a48ecd_936x370.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="370" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb4e282b9-21d6-4c26-9476-14bd24a48ecd_936x370.png" width="936" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">There are three core concepts in Opepen &#8211; Sets, Rarity and Opt-In.</figcaption></figure></div><h2>Sets</h2><p>The 16K Opepen NFTs are divided into 200 sets, or sub-collections, where each Set has a total of 80 NFTs [3]. Each Set features a different artist that will create art for that particular set. Since Opepen is a framework of recognizable shapes, each Set becomes a canvas for a specific artist to reimagine and manifest their artwork onto the Opepen framework. By structuring the project as 200 Sets, Opepen can collaborate with different artists and feature a variety of artistic styles. Structuring releases through sets expands the surface area for attention but does so in a collaborative way [4].</p><h2>Rarity</h2><p>Out of the 16K Opepen NFTs, rarity breaks down as follows [5]:</p><ul><li><p>Forty: Total of 8,000 NFTs</p></li><li><p>Twenty: Total of 4,000 NFTs</p></li><li><p>Ten: Total of 2,000 NFTs</p></li><li><p>Five: Total of 1,000 NFTs</p></li><li><p>Four: Total of 800 NFTs</p></li><li><p>One: Total of 200 NFTs</p></li></ul><p>Within each Set of 80 NFTs, there are 6 images, one for each rarity. The &#8220;One&#8221; NFTs are the most rare and represent the 1 of 1s in a particular Set of 80 NFTs, whereas the &#8220;Forty&#8221; NFTs are the least rare, with 40 NFTs having the &#8220;Forty&#8221; image in a Set.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F36b014d1-1d02-4338-843d-848ac1a8235c_388x504.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="504" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F36b014d1-1d02-4338-843d-848ac1a8235c_388x504.png" width="388" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><a href="https://twitter.com/jackbutcher/status/1616269895200641025/photo/1">Image Source</a></figcaption></figure></div><h2>The Opt-In Mechanism</h2><p>The 16,000 Opepen NFTs start as &#8220;unrevealed.&#8221; To reveal the Opepen NFTs, the project uses its Opt-In mechanism. The goal of the Opt-In Mechanism is to allow the NFT holders to decide which artists get approved to be included into an Opepen Set. It does so in the following steps:</p><ol><li><p>For each set, Jack pitches a set to the community which includes highlighting the artist and previewing the set&#8217;s art on Opepen&#8217;s website.</p></li><li><p>Holders of the unrevealed Opepen NFTs choose whether to opt-in to a set. If they opt-in, by signing a message on the Opepen website, they are signaling that they want to include their unrevealed Opepen NFT into the pool to be selected for a reveal.</p></li><li><p>For a set to be released, it must pass a threshold of opt-ins. For example, if the Set gets less than x% opt-in across the different rarities, then the set will not launch. (At the time of this writing, a set must have ~2,000% demand to be revealed). If the set does not meet the opt-in threshold, Jack goes back to the drawing board and pitches another set to the community. For example, if Jack pitches a Set with Artist A, and not enough (does not meet the 2,000% threshold) unrevealed Opepen NFTs opt-in to that Set, then the Set does not proceed to launch and a new artist collaboration gets pitched.</p></li><li><p>For Sets that meet the opt-in threshold, the NFTs that opted in get selected randomly (at each rarity level) to be revealed.</p></li></ol><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32d68dc4-b53d-40b3-a47d-2c9e243185b6_610x614.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="614" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32d68dc4-b53d-40b3-a47d-2c9e243185b6_610x614.png" width="610" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Set 025 Opt-In Metrics,<a href="https://opepen.art/sets/025"> Image Source</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>The opt-in mechanism, particularly step 2 above, gives the NFT holders power to decide what they like (or not like) by voting with their NFTs on which Sets they want to see included into the collection. But this isn&#8217;t solely a community decision because ultimately Jack is the curator, as outlined in Step 1, of which Sets and artists are presented for opt-in. Furthermore, any artist can submit a set to be considered for opt-in [6] but Jack (still) decides and curates which Set to present to the community for opt-in. This creates a symbiotic relationship: trust the founders to curate but let the holders decide &#8212; a &#8220;bottom-up x top-down&#8221; collaboration.</p><h1>Creating a Framework That Promotes Remixing</h1><p>To date, Opepen has released 32 of the 200 Sets and featured various artists and collaborations. For example, Set 001 (the first set) was created by Jack Butcher, himself [7]. Set 023 was created by Opepen community member Jhekub [8]. Set 025 was a collaboration between Jack and SnowFro [9].</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4ee1af5e-848d-4b02-acd3-d34aefffb581_1600x602.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="548" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4ee1af5e-848d-4b02-acd3-d34aefffb581_1600x602.png" width="1456" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>But participation in Opepen isn&#8217;t purely through the 200 &#8220;official&#8221; Sets. Opepen's "core art" is a framework made up of recognizable shapes. Jack and Jalil (lead dev of Opepen) have encouraged the community to remix the Opepen image freely regardless of if they hold the NFT or not. This has led to the proliferation of remixed images on top of the Opepen framework where the community has added layers to the original image. The implicit requirement is that one follows the framework so that the remix image is recognizable as an Opepen image. But since Opepen is a series of simple base shapes, what is considered Opepen ends up being fairly broad. For example, all of the below images look different, yet they are all Opepen. Some were created by Jack and some were created by community members.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc802d7c0-9fee-4317-9b7c-5d9b90ef310e_546x546.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="546" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc802d7c0-9fee-4317-9b7c-5d9b90ef310e_546x546.png" width="546" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Image Found <a href="https://twitter.com/jackbutcher/status/1647968374226288641">Here</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>By encouraging permissionless remixing (the Opepen base image is CC0 [10]), the Opepen framework fosters a sense of community among creators &#8211; an Opepen derivative image is instantly recognizable to others who have used the same framework. By defining constraints while allowing for open-ended creation, Opepen strikes a balance between a completed work and an ongoing conversation. This has led to a constantly evolving / community-driven body of work, where no single image is considered to be the canonical Opepen.</p><p>The canonical Opepen image is the framework. Everything else is a derivative &#8211; whether it is the derivative images included in the official 200 sets through the community opt-in mechanism or images that others create and post on social media.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5fc4bfd8-bd0f-4239-96bf-813102206891_590x526.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="526" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5fc4bfd8-bd0f-4239-96bf-813102206891_590x526.png" width="590" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Image adapted from this<a href="https://twitter.com/jhekub/status/1748101075213729975?s=20"> Tweet</a></figcaption></figure></div><h1>Remix Culture and Attention-Based Network Effects</h1><p>The network effects of Opepen are powered by derivatives because derivatives broaden the attention given to the project. By creating an easy to remix framework that allows for infinite derivation, there are many ways others could add to the attention of Opepen. Some examples include:</p><ul><li><p>An artist might collaborate with Opepen through one of the official 200 Sets and highlight Opepen to their community as a result. Opepen Set 011 [11] which was a collaboration with Pudgy Penguins was a good example of this.</p></li><li><p>A creator might create a remix of an Opepen derivative image for another community member in Opepen [12].&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>An artist might create a separate NFT collection based on Opepen that is unrelated to the 200 Sets but is based on the Opepen framework. Kozi&#8217;s (an Opepen community member) Dohpepen Set [13] is a good example of a collection that is related to Opepen but isn&#8217;t in the 200 Sets that Jack is curating.</p></li></ul><p>In the above examples, each new piece of art or derivative doesn't stand alone, they all contribute to and benefit from the collective attention that accrues to Opepen. Each remix and derivative adds another &#8220;block&#8221; to the &#8220;chain of Opepen art.&#8221;</p><p>The above conditions create a flywheel that encourages others &#8211; leading artists, amateurs, creators, etc &#8211; to remix the Opepen image, which further adds to the attention of the project, which further encourages others to dive into the project.</p><p>Opepen has opted for a model that allows anyone to join the Opepen community, where the (soft) entry requirement is any contribution to Opepen&#8217;s attention &#8211; creating a derivative image, writing a thread about the project, hosting a space for the community (just to name a few). This has enabled a positive sum game where the community begins to look like a network versus a top-down structure. In this network, one does not have to be an NFT holder or have a large position in the network to be notable. Designing the project to look like a network enables community members to find their sub-community but still be a part of a massive and growing umbrella community. The network structure is positive-sum. If you are an artist, you might be the leader of your sub-community, but that does not preclude you from being a supporter in a different sub-community elsewhere in the Opepen community.</p><h2>Open-Source Art Protocol</h2><p>Taking the above, we can view Opepen as an open-source art protocol. Traditionally, a protocol refers to the underlying rules of engagements for computers. Similarly, in Web3, a protocol might describe how different machines reach consensus, which actions users can take given that some conditions are met, so on and so forth.</p><p>Viewing Opepen through the lenses of a protocol looks something like this:</p><ul><li><p>The Opepen Framework is open for others to remix and make derivatives. You can use any tool and/or medium.</p></li><li><p>Whether a remixed image is related to Opepen is defined by following the framework and the attention given to it, (i.e. do others see it as an Opepen derivative?)</p></li><li><p>Derivatives add value to the protocol &#8211; each derivative brings attention to Opepen and broadens its attention-based network effects. Attention sustains Opepen.</p></li><li><p>Each Opepen image or derivative adds to the collective "state" (history) of the Opepen universe.</p></li></ul><p>The Opepen &#8220;protocol&#8221; is effectively a set of artistic guidelines and foundational design elements (the recognizable shapes) &#8211; it&#8217;s a creative template that is open for anyone to use and remix.</p><h2>Open-Source Values</h2><p>Opepen was designed to be an open-source community. For this to work at scale, there needs to be an environment that promotes remixing. There are several conditions that enable this in the Opepen community:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Building blocks and simple frameworks:</strong> Simple frameworks (i.e. Opepen shapes) help define constraints which reduces the activation energy needed for someone to create on top of the framework. Building blocks enable composability and give others tools to create. In Opepen, the building blocks are often images, but more tactically they are things that make it easier for someone to remix. For example, a community member sharing a public Figma file for others to use. Ironically, giving others the building blocks and defining constraints makes the Opepen image infinitely remixable.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Attracting a community of contributors:</strong> Similar to open-source software communities, Opepen is maintained by its community of contributors. Jack and Jalil&#8217;s philosophy of promoting remixing has organically attracted like minded individuals to join the community. Those community members then reinforce the culture of remixing. For example, community members like Jhekub led workshops on how to use AI to remix the Opepen image [14]. Beyond actual creation, another community member, BoredElonMusk spun up a weekly community space [15] as a place for the community to get together and talk about all things Opepen.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Make it permissionless:</strong> Aside from the Opepen image being CC0, the culture in the Opepen community centers around permissionless remixing. If you have an idea, the default approach is to &#8220;go for it,&#8221; as there isn&#8217;t really anyone you need to ask for permission. Unlike traditional art ecosystems where value is often dictated by a few gatekeepers, Opepen allows anyone to put forth a piece of art, but the community collectively decides what's valuable by the attention they give to that image.</p></li></ul><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>The journey of the Opepen community has always been organic, which follows Jack&#8217;s philosophy to put your work out there and let others react. This means Opepen is a lot of different things to a lot of different people.</p><p>Conversely, one of the hardest questions to answer, even amongst the community members, is &#8220;What is Opepen?&#8221; Some see Opepen as a meme, a philosophy, a design template, a community of artists, an attention-based network, and an open-source art protocol. Perhaps this experimentation itself is the most valuable part of Opepen.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Thanks for reading the Stanford Blockchain Review!

In addition to its swap feature, Jupiter offers Limit Orders and Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA). Jupiter has facilitated over $60 billion in Volume since its inception in late 2021. Alongside the growth of Solana over the year, Jupiter&#8217;s monthly routed volume has increased 2300% since the beginning of 2023 [1].</p><p>In this article, we will explore how Jupiter builds features to leverage Solana&#8217;s unique strengths, assess Jupiter&#8217;s impact on the overall Solana ecosystem, and evaluate the project&#8217;s future visions and directions.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb59c1ed-0183-4542-a57d-4172b2d93cd8_1600x943.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="858" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb59c1ed-0183-4542-a57d-4172b2d93cd8_1600x943.png" width="1456" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><h2>The Go-To Platform For Swaps on Solana</h2><p>Ethereum and Solana present contrasting landscapes in terms of volume and usage. On Ethereum, aggregators like 1inch, 0x, CoW, and Paraswap manage a fraction of the total DEX volume, routing about 20-25% collectively. The majority of users prefer to use DEX Uniswap for their transactions [2].</p><p>In contrast, Jupiter dominates Solana&#8217;s DEX landscape by routing more than 80% of the total volume, a stark difference from Ethereum's scenario. Despite Raydium and Orca being the top two DEXes on Solana in terms of volume, the bulk of users opt for Jupiter for their swapping needs. This unique position of Jupiter on Solana illustrates its significant impact and user preference in the Solana ecosystem [3].</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb0db45b-220b-4fab-8360-4f00e1b10e37_1382x794.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="794" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb0db45b-220b-4fab-8360-4f00e1b10e37_1382x794.png" width="1382" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><h1>Jupiter&#8217;s Features: Leveraging Solana&#8217;s Strengths</h1><p>Part of Jupiter&#8217;s dominance as the go-to platform for swaps in the Solana ecosystem can be attributed to leveraging Solana&#8217;s capabilities and features. Solana&#8217;s characteristics, such as low gas fees and multistate accounts, enable Jupiter to have better pricing and user experience as an aggregator.&nbsp;</p><h2>Low Gas Fees Enable Better Pricing and New Features</h2><p>Fees on Ethereum typically cost <a href="https://l2fees.info/">$5-15</a> for swaps [4]. This directly affects how much better price aggregators on Ethereum vs. a single dex. For your average user on Ethereum, a swap on 1inch may be minimally cheaper than swapping on Uniswap due to gas fees.</p><p>Dex aggregators operate by allocating portions of transactions across multiple liquidity sources, each which offer different exchange rates. To swap WETH for DAI, a service like 1inch might get a better deal than a direct full swap by breaking up some of the WETH and trading it to USDT on one exchange, then it will convert the USDT to USDC on DoDo. Finally it will convert it to DAI on Uniswap V3, all because it finds that the USDC-DAI liquidity pair is better. This is shown in the image below:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbf485849-0a08-4ad0-93f9-3b2160d9d177_828x641.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="641" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbf485849-0a08-4ad0-93f9-3b2160d9d177_828x641.png" width="828" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>However, the more routes and contract interactions a path takes, the more gas is required. Thus, while the best price without gas might have been a complex split across 6 or 7 paths, such a route would be realistically too expensive with gas. Aggregators operating on Ethereum put a lot of focus instead on gas optimization for better pricing.&nbsp;</p><p>Jupiter takes advantage of Solana&#8217;s sub-cent gas fees with its Metis algorithm, which can generate the best possible paths regardless of complexity or length [5]. By utilizing the Bellman-Ford algorithm to iteratively build a route that can split and merge at any stage, Jupiter quotes prices that are 5.2% better than its older v2 algorithm [6].</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd12bd70-d4a2-45e8-9b7f-4a9cbb1082e4_1476x828.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="817" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd12bd70-d4a2-45e8-9b7f-4a9cbb1082e4_1476x828.png" width="1456" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><h2>Throughput Enables Better Limit Order Execution</h2><p>Solana&#8217;s high throughput and fast transaction speed can be particularly beneficial for executing limit orders. In fast-moving markets, where oracle prices can vary rapidly, execution is critical. Quick execution is important for needs such as catching wicks, a common phenomenon where a sell order causes a very brief 20% or higher drawdown in price.&nbsp;</p><p>Solana enables Jupiter to have limit orders that have fast execution. Whereas slower transaction speeds and congestion may mean that an order may fail on other chains, Solana&#8217;s speed enhances the ability to execute these trades effectively.</p><h2>Token Ledger for Increased Swap Success Rates</h2><p>A common issue with DEX aggregators is that direct swaps can fail [7]. These platforms use simulations to figure out the best trading paths, however estimated results from simulations can differ from what actually happens at the time you trade. During periods of high volatility, swaps can often fail due to high slippage.</p><p>Instead of approximating the amount, Jupiter&#8217;s Token Ledger takes advantage of Solana&#8217;s multistate program capabilities to calculate all actual amounts transacted. It then combines all instructions into one transaction, which is executed atomically, increasing swap success rate [8].</p><h1>Impact on Solana&#8217;s Ecosystem</h1><h2>Integrations</h2><h3>Swap Interface For Applications</h3><p>Data Aggregation platforms like Birdeye and Hellomoon use Jupiter Swaps to generate revenue by adding Jupiter Terminal to their UI and adding a platform fee [9].</p><p>With the advent of games on Solana, Jupiter has also made it easy for Game Developers to integrate swaps into their games. They partnered with MagicBlock, the team behind Solana&#8217;s Unity SDK, so Solana games like Star Atlas, DeFiLand, and GenoPets can use Jupiter for marketplace purchases, asset-swaps, and gamified trading experiences.</p><h3>Margin Products</h3><p>Jupiter integrates with platforms like Solend, Solana&#8217;s premier lend and borrowing platform, and Drift Protocol, one of Solana&#8217;s top perpetual exchanges, for better margin trading experience.</p><p>Before Jupiter, users would use Solend manually to do margin trading swaps, borrowing, swapping on another platform, and depositing collateral back into Solend [10]. By integrating flash loans with Jupiter swaps, Sollend users can do margin trading swaps all in one transaction. Drift additionally combines flash loans and Jupiter&#8217;s deep liquidity so users can trade with up to 5x leverage at the best prices.</p><h3>Payments&nbsp;</h3><p>Jupiter built out ExactOut API, which allows exact payments with any token. It allows users to specify a precise amount of output tokens that a user requires, and the input token amount is calculated accordingly. Payment Platforms like Helio and Sphere leverage Jupiter so platforms can take payments with any SPL token [8].</p><h2>Enabling DEX Competition</h2><p>By creating a hub where most of Solana&#8217;s users use Jupiter on the frontend or backend as their swap platform, Jupiter does not just find the lowest prices. It encourages even lower prices by enabling competition. While Uniswap volume continues to dominate the majority of volume on the Ethereum ecosystem, on Solana there seems to be more and more fragmentation of volume occurring:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fddd2a9da-4e8c-4d92-856e-76193b0333ae_1384x798.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="798" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fddd2a9da-4e8c-4d92-856e-76193b0333ae_1384x798.png" width="1384" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>This could be because Jupiter makes it easier for new DEXes to spring up. On chains without high usage of aggregators, a new protocol might need to rely more on liquidity mining strategies and marketing to gain initial users and volume. Now, as long as the DEX has a strategy to have competitive prices, integrating with Jupiter ensures that the DEX will gain sizable volume. Incumbents cannot just rest on their laurels-they know that since most users use Jupiter, they will lose market share as Jupiter will route to the dex with the best price.</p><p>Phoenix is a fully-on-chain limit order book that receives significant volume from Jupiter. GooseFX, which created Single Sided Liquidity pools, so depositors can earn fees by providing a single asset, receives most of its swap volume from Jupiter. Lifinity, a capital-efficient proactive market maker that receives more than 10% of Solana&#8217;s Dex Volume, captures almost all of its volume through Jupiter on Solana [3][11].</p><p>By creating more DEX competition, Jupiter not only creates better prices for the ecosystem, but strengthens its position as the leading location to trade on Solana. Increasing the diversity of DEX systems means more liquidity fragmentation, increasing the need for Jupiter&#8217;s aggregation for the best prices and selection.</p><h1>Jupiter&#8217;s Future</h1><p>The Jupiter team&#8217;s vision for the future centers around what they call &#8220;growing the pie&#8221;: the idea that driving the growth and prosperity of the Solana ecosystem will result in Jupiter&#8217;s future success. This ultimately means making efforts and building out products that drive users to Solana.</p><h2>JUP Airdrop and Speculation</h2><p>The most recent and direct effort to drive users is the upcoming JUP airdrop. At the end of January, Jupiter plans to airdrop its first round of JUP, its governance token. Jupiter will airdrop 1 billion tokens, or 10% of the supply, to previous Jupiter users based on factors like their past usage and trading volume [12]. Jupiter plans on having 3 more airdrops for users of the platform.&nbsp;</p><p>Aevo.xyz, which is running a liquid pre-launch tokens market for JUP, currently prices the governance token to be worth several billion dollars in fully diluted value [13]. If JUP launches at where futures markets expect, billions of dollars in incentives could drive an influx of users to use Jupiter, potentially driving much more volume and liquidity to Solana. Solana DEX Volumes flipping Ethereum could become a more common occurrence [14].</p><p>However, the long-term impact of this strategy on platform growth and token value remains yet to be seen. Airdrop farmers may boost stats, but retention from a great user experience and a great surrounding ecosystem is necessary for long-term growth. Furthermore, selling pressure from future airdrops due to mercenary farmers could reduce JUP&#8217;s valuation. Lastly, JUP appears to be purely governance for now-there will be no fee sharing for at least 2 years, and while Limit Orders and Dollar-Cost-Averaging (DCA) features make revenue with its 0.1% fees, Jupiter makes no revenue off of swaps [15].</p><h2>Products</h2><p>Jupiter is working on various products to drive users to Solana. Jupiter Start is in the works, an attempt to grow the pie by creating a better launchpad for upcoming projects on Solana. Their Pre-Listing process streamlines the introduction of a new token onto Jupiter and other integrated platforms. By going through the pre-listing process via community attestation and specifying the exact time liquidity is added, projects can enhance liquidity and availability of their token.</p><p>The team is also building out xSOL, similar to Maker&#8217;s stablecoin backed by ETH-a leveraged stablecoin based on LSTs that will offer 7-20% yield annually. Finally, there is Jupiter Perpetuals, a LP perpetual exchange which offers 100x leverage on Solana [8].&nbsp;</p><h2>Vision</h2><p>Meow, co-founder of Jupiter, sees a world where Jupiter replaces traditional centralized exchanges (CEX) [16]. Achieving this vision requires overcoming several hurdles. While Jupiter&#8217;s spot token selection is increasing, selection is currently specific to Solana SPL tokens, and liquidity needs to deepen significantly to rival pricing of exchanges like Binance. Finally, the on-chain user experience still faces challenges, hindered by issues with wallet onboarding, contract security risk, and miner extractable value (MEV). Furthermore, it is necessary to address Solana-centric issues such as its inflationary tokenomics, which subsidize the blockchain&#8217;s low fees, and potential downtime from bots [17][18].</p><p>There are emerging responses in the ecosystem. Clients like Jito, which democratizes MEV, mitigating bot impact, and Firedancer, which aims to vastly increase transaction capacity, represent efforts to address these issues [19][20]. If these hurdles are overcome and Jupiter achieves its vision to replace the CEX, millions of users would be brought on-chain, accelerating the broader adoption of decentralized applications.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Thanks for reading the Stanford Blockchain Review!

Despite beginning as an open and non-profit network, much of the Internet&#8217;s value today is captured by a handful of big tech companies such as Google, Meta, and Amazon. Within &#8220;Read Write Own,&#8221; however, we present a vision of blockchains as a new turning point in the Internet&#8217;s evolution [1].&nbsp;</p><p>In this article, we will explore some of the major themes within &#8220;Read Write Own,&#8221; such as situating blockchains within the broader context of Internet history and network economies, discussing the importance of &#8220;tokens&#8221; as a new digital primitive, the relationship between &#8220;casino culture&#8221; and &#8220;computer culture&#8221; in the crypto space, as well as how blockchains reinvent the idea of digital ownership. In doing so, we will show how by giving value back to users, creators, and entrepreneurs at the &#8220;edges&#8221; of the network, blockchains represent a technological breakthrough that redefines ownership dynamics to unlock new possibilities for innovation.</p><h2>Network Economies and the History of the Internet</h2><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc3627081-cc88-4a4d-816e-fb047994220c_1248x1132.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="559.650641025641" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc3627081-cc88-4a4d-816e-fb047994220c_1248x1132.png" width="617" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Network Stack. Source [1].</figcaption></figure></div><p>To understand blockchains&#8217; technological and cultural significance, we need to place them in the context of broader Internet history. Fundamentally, what we call the &#8220;Internet&#8221; today is an intricate &#8220;network of networks,&#8221; built up of several layers of network protocol technologies that form the &#8220;Internet Protocol Stack&#8221; [2]. This reaches from the basic network transfer protocols, such as IP, or the Internet Protocol, to application-layer network protocols such as SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) for email or HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) for the World Wide Web [2], to the even more abstracted social networks within specific applications themselves, such as for Facebook and X (fka. Twitter).</p><p>Much of the value of the Internet &#8211; such as our social networks, our financial histories, and medical records &#8211; are all recorded and captured on these interlocking network structures. Thus, to understand the modern Internet, we need to understand network design, since the way these networks are designed directly affects how money and power flows through the network system.</p><p>Before the advent of blockchain technologies, there were two primary designs of network economies: protocol networks and corporate networks.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4c94a1f-9f31-4b3c-b358-9c8c3d28d351_1522x710.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="679" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4c94a1f-9f31-4b3c-b358-9c8c3d28d351_1522x710.png" width="1456" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Protocol and Corporate Networks. Source [1].</figcaption></figure></div><p>A protocol network is defined by a set of open-source rules that describe how different participants in the network interact with each other. As the protocol is completely open-source, any of the participants easily bootstrap applications using this code and all the value accrues to the participants of the protocol, rather than any centralized entity charging exorbitant fees for network use. Like all networks, the value of a protocol increases as more participants enter into the network. One of the most classic examples of protocol networks is <a href="https://rss.com/">RSS, or the Really Simple Syndication protocol</a>, which is an open-source web feed format that allows users to subscribe to content from other users and websites that they follow [3]. This open-source protocol was frequently used to subscribe to content outlets such as blog entries, news headlines, and podcast episodes.</p><p>A corporate network, on the other hand, is a closed-source network, such as Facebook or Twitter, where a single company designs, maintains, and distributes the network in order to advance its own corporate interests. Although many of these corporate networks support APIs and an ecosystem of outside developers and creators on their platform, their interests are secondary to the profit-seeking motives of the core company. As such, many of these corporate networks have incredibly high &#8220;take rates,&#8221; where the vast majority of the value that creators, developers, and other users on the network accrue to the platform, rather than to the users themselves.</p><p>As the modern Internet has matured, we&#8217;ve systematically seen closed corporate networks, such as Facebook or Twitter outcompete open protocol networks such as RSS. Twitter, for example, actually started out as an easy-to-use front-end built to support RSS, but gradually users began to solely rely on Twitter&#8217;s platform and network rather than that of RSS. Eventually, Twitter completely supplanted RSS in popularity, and the company decided to end its support for RSS feeds in 2013.</p><p>One of the core reasons why these corporate networks are able to take advantage and supplant these open protocol networks is because they are incredibly well-funded and are well designed to put forward their own strategic interests. Platforms such as Amazon, YouTube, and Uber, for example, are more than happy to initially suffer losses to subsidize their growth and attract users to their platform. Many protocol networks, on the other hand, lack systematic funding for continued development and maintenance of the project because of their decentralized nature, with many developers maintaining the network out of pure goodwill. Thus, these open protocol networks cannot hope to compete with the &#8220;war-chest&#8221; of a corporate network. All this has greatly undermined the Internet&#8217;s founding ethos of being an open, public space to share and advance knowledge for all.</p><h2>Tokens, Computers, and Casinos</h2><p>Blockchains, on the other hand, introduce a new form of network economy, one that combines the openness of protocol networks with the funding mechanism that allow them to compete with the teams of corporate networks. This is done so through the introduction of &#8220;tokens&#8221; as a new primitive to represent both a unit of ownership and a unit of value within a blockchain application.</p><p>Consider Bitcoin, the oldest and most well-known blockchain project. The Bitcoin blockchain essentially acts as a massive, decentralized &#8220;ledger&#8221; (similar to an Excel spreadsheet) that permanently records all financial transactions on the network [4]. This big &#8220;ledger&#8221; is maintained and replicated on millions of computers around the world called &#8220;miners&#8221; or &#8220;validators&#8221; on the network, who are rewarded for their work in maintaining this ledger through Bitcoin &#8220;tokens,&#8221; with the specific rewards determined through an algorithm known as &#8220;Proof of Work&#8221;. Essentially, Bitcoin &#8220;tokens&#8221; (BTC) serve as both a unit of value and a metric of ownership to incentivize participants of the network to act in a particular way, such as maintaining the financial ledger through the &#8220;Proof of Work&#8221; algorithm [5].</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F90603ed9-82ad-4198-b7bd-99265a8d71ad_1600x1003.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="913" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F90603ed9-82ad-4198-b7bd-99265a8d71ad_1600x1003.png" width="1456" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Rough outline of Proof of Work Algorithm. Source [5].</figcaption></figure></div><p>Tokens provide a flexible framework to coordinate behavior on a mass scale &#8211; we can easily switch out Bitcoin's &#8220;Proof of Work&#8221; reward algorithm for another algorithm in different applications. Ethereum, for example, uses a &#8220;Proof of Stake&#8221; algorithm to extend Bitcoin&#8217;s Excel-like decentralized ledger into a fully Turing complete global computer. All this creates a new discipline in the blockchain industry known as &#8220;tokenomics,&#8221; which incorporates elements of computer science, economics, and game theory to design effective token-reward systems for blockchain applications.</p><p>Unfortunately, the idea of &#8220;coins&#8221; and &#8220;tokens&#8221; in crypto often brings to mind negative connotations and the stereotypical depiction of crypto as nothing more than an unregulated online casino. Although there are many cases of bad actors within the blockchain space, such as Terra founder Do Kwon and FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried who exploit the industry&#8217;s novelty to perpetuate fraudulent schemes, this caricature of the crypto space obscures the real innovations and technological advancements in the industry.</p><p>Roughly speaking, crypto can be characterized as having two distinct cultures: the &#8220;computer&#8221; and the &#8220;casino.&#8221; The &#8220;computer culture&#8221; represents the developers, entrepreneurs, and visionaries that can situate &#8220;crypto&#8221; within the broader history of the Internet and understand blockchains&#8217; technological significance in the long run. On the other hand, the &#8220;casino&#8221; culture is much more focused on short-term gains and profiting from price fluctuations.</p><p>It is our hope that with greater regulation and increased legal clarity, it is possible to mitigate the myopic and harmful effects of &#8220;casino culture&#8221;. One potential solution could be to make great use of vesting schemes and time horizons, locking up tokens for some specified amount of time either through technical means such as staking or through traditional legal means such as contracts. In turn, this could promote more long-term thinking in the space and thus promote blockchain technologies as a force for social good.</p><h2>Reinventing Digital Ownership</h2><p>The key to promoting a healthy, vibrant culture in the blockchain industry is to harness the power of &#8220;computer culture&#8221; within the crypto movement. Fundamentally, tokens allow blockchains to redefine the concept of ownership on digital networks. For many blockchain projects, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, there is no single person or company that &#8220;owns&#8221; the network, as whoever owns the token of the network, such as ETH or BTC, is the owner of the network, and all the code of the protocol &#8211; such as the algorithms determining the distribution of token rewards &#8211; is open source.</p><p>As such, blockchains are a natural inheritor of the open, collaborative spirit of protocol networks. At the same time, because tokens such as ETH and BTC represent units of value that can be exchanged for real money, participants on blockchain networks are also able to fund project development and maintenance to compete with corporate networks.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ae1ec61-43e7-4f27-94da-cd4075bb2e42_1600x1247.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="359.3646978021978" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ae1ec61-43e7-4f27-94da-cd4075bb2e42_1600x1247.png" width="461" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Token Incentives and Network Effects. Source [1].</figcaption></figure></div><p>Already, we&#8217;ve seen the potential of harnessing &#8220;tokens&#8221; and other blockchain technologies as a force for social good and giving back to a community. <a href="https://www.helium.com/">Helium</a>, for example, rewards its users with HNT tokens for setting up wireless hotspot hubs to provide wireless connectivity, allowing communities ignored by traditional internet service providers Internet access [6]. Through the deft use of token incentives, Helium is able to bootstrap an interconnected network of hotspot hubs, to enjoy network effects. This is an exemplary case of how tokens allow much smaller companies to overcome the traditional &#8220;cold start problems&#8221; and disrupt much larger incumbents, such as traditional Internet service providers. As the project matures, users with HNT tokens are also able to actively participate in the governance of the protocol and allow these early adopters to have a voice in the future directions of the project.</p><p>Thus, blockchains structurally redefine the concept of digital ownership, redistributing the profits of a network back to the users and communities that created this value in the first place. Through creating a novel incentive structure for network participants on open protocols, blockchains disrupt the &#8220;winner-takes-all&#8221; model of &#8220;corporate networks&#8221;, and return the Internet back to its original free, decentralized, and democratic values.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82dcd1ee-b6a1-4346-8b9a-9be99bf8cf4a_1600x516.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="470" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82dcd1ee-b6a1-4346-8b9a-9be99bf8cf4a_1600x516.png" width="1456" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Protocol, Corporate, and Blockchain Networks. Source [1].</figcaption></figure></div><h2>The Future of Blockchains</h2><p>Today, we&#8217;re at an inflection point in the crypto space. Over the past few years, there has been systematic improvement in blockchain infrastructure and technologies on numerous fronts, such as the advance of zero knowledge proofs, modular blockchains, and interoperability solutions. In the same way that underlying improvements in GPUs paved the way for the &#8220;killer app&#8221; of ChatGPT, we believe that blockchain infrastructure may soon enable the advent of a &#8220;killer app&#8221; in the crypto space, one that serves as an &#8220;iPhone moment&#8221; in its significance for wider adoption.</p><p>As the crypto industry turns over a new leaf over the previous series of collapses over the past year and a half, we look forward to seeing the diverse array of new blockchain projects that may arise, such as novel social networks, games and the metaverse, open-source financial infrastructure, and a new AI-centric creator economy that will drive forward the next stage of the Internet&#8217;s evolution.</p><p>Ultimately, blockchains today represent a frontier in computing, just as the Internet once was in the 1990s. Unlike other frontier technologies such as AI and VR/AR, which primarily benefit and sustain the hegemony of big-tech incumbents, crypto represents a true disrupting force that redistributes value back to the edges of a network, empowering the creators, users, and participants of a network to become true owners of a protocol and building a new &#8220;Read, Write, Own&#8221; economy in the digital realm.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Thanks for reading the Stanford Blockchain Review!

<div> 关键词：隐私、DeFi、ZK-隐私协议、KYC(B)、Hinkal

总结:<br />
文章探讨了传统金融和去中心化金融（DeFi）中的隐私问题。在传统金融中，隐私通常由KYC/B业务验证提供，而在DeFi中，虽然交易可追踪但并非匿名，可能导致用户策略被跟踪和攻击。为了解决这个问题，文章提出了零知识（ZK）隐私协议，如Hinkal，它使用屏蔽地址、零知识证明和隐匿地址来保护用户隐私。通过KYC/B认证，确保只有合法用户能享受隐私，同时满足监管要求。Hinkal通过其解决方案，实现了资本效率与隐私的平衡，为机构投资者进入DeFi铺平道路。 <div>

Your transactions are only known by you and the participating parties. When opening a bank account, only you and the bank have knowledge of the account. Government authorities may gain access upon request.</p><p>In order to open a bank account, the customer has to pass a KYC(B) (Know Your Customer/Business) check. This ensures that no illicit parties are allowed to use the bank&#8217;s services and no illegal activities can be facilitated through it.</p><p>In short, in TradFi, KYC(B) verification and privacy co-exist. Information about transactions is invisible to anyone except the participants and the facilitators (banks).&nbsp;</p><p>The same approach can be applied to on-chain transactions, but more importantly, users can achieve this with less friction - providing attestations i.e. reusable KYC(B) layer. In this article, we are going to examine how privacy can be provided in the crypto space while making sure no illicit parties can benefit from it. [1]</p><h1>Privacy in DeFi</h1><p>Privacy in decentralized finance (DeFi) transactions is more complex. Transactions in crypto are not anonymous, but rather pseudonymous, meaning they can all be traced back to your wallet address.</p><p>Let&#8217;s take as an example a user who on-ramps through a Centralized Exchange (CEX). After buying USDC, they move them to the self-custodial wallet. The history of that wallet address and its transactions from now on are all publicly accessible. An average user, unless Arkham or Nansen researchers found a way to label them, stays pseudonymous with the wallet address being their pseudonym.</p><p>But here is the issue - although the actual identity of the user is hidden, all their transactions remain publicly visible. As a result, all significant token holders are traced and soon copy-traded, front-runned or become targets of hackers [2].</p><p>Who suffers from this mostly?</p><ol><li><p>Active DeFi traders whose main job is to make a profit on-chain. Suddenly they are followed by hundreds of other wallets just repeating their actions which diminishes their yields. Why does the yield go down? The law of diminishing returns applies to all token transactions. So if you are providing liquidity (LP) on Curve - more people do LP, yields go down. The same law applies to staking, borrowing/lending, and in most cases for swaps with some exceptions in each category.&nbsp;</p></li></ol><p>If no one can link your history or assets, running your strategies stays profitable. That&#8217;s where the meaning of economic privacy is derived from.&nbsp;</p><ol start="2"><li><p>Fund managers using managed accounts. How can we ensure that there&#8217;s no immediate visibility of all transactions, so they can run their strategies without immediately disclosing positions to their LP/account holders? Here privacy comes with a different flavor of justifying performance fees that is possible with smart contract privacy and viewing keys to show transactions at the end of the trading sessions.<br /><br /></p></li><li><p>Crypto VCs liquidating vested tokens from the projects they invested in. It always provides bad market signals even if the VCs just need liquidity - so they use CEXs or OTC (Over the Counter) markets. Here, privacy is needed to have an option to liquidate tokens on DEXs without having a market impact.&nbsp;</p></li></ol><ol start="4"><li><p>Other use cases include investment strategies such as buy-and-hold of illiquid tokens on DEXs and CEX-DEX arbitrage, but also payroll or B2B payments. They are smaller in scale but still very relevant and growing use cases.</p></li></ol><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3aff34b-2a13-496a-88e7-104e20c26679_1600x900.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="819" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3aff34b-2a13-496a-88e7-104e20c26679_1600x900.png" width="1456" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><h1>Solving Privacy in DeFi</h1><p>The solution to this problem comes in the form of a ZK-privacy protocol utilizing shielded addresses and stealth addresses, relayers, and KYC(B) attestations.&nbsp;</p><p>This way, users can execute transactions without:</p><p>a) any link to their actual wallet</p><p>b) any history of previous transactions, while maintaining full custody over the assets.</p><p>Instead of transacting directly from their wallets, users pass their transactions through a relayer, utilizing ZK technology to prove ownership over the funds without revealing the identity of the owners.

It is a common misconception that KYC(B) verification equals loss of privacy and pseudonymity.<strong> </strong>If we revisit the TradFi example with the bank accounts, we can see that there is a way to preserve privacy while passing through the verification process.<br /><br />We adopt a similar concept in DeFi. The advantage over TradFi is the reusability of attestations. Many users have accounts at institutions such as Coinbase or Binance. Now such attestations can be used to verify that users passed KYC(B) and then allow them to participate in private transactions using Hinkal and integrated dApps. If they don&#8217;t have such attestations from institutions or any other KYC(B)/DID protocols, they need to pass KYC(B) only once. They can use this attestation everywhere in the blockchain domain since the minted &#8220;Access token&#8221; can be used in other dApps. The Access Token maintains full privacy and doesn&#8217;t disclose any personal information. What it guarantees is that there&#8217;s a way to deanonymize the user and match to off-chain records in case there&#8217;s a government request, similar to what reusable attestation does.</p><p>This is exactly the concept that Hinkal implements.</p><h1>Hinkal&#8217;s Solution</h1><p>Hinkal is a zk-protocol enabling end-to-end and secure confidentiality for DeFi transactions. Hinkal allows liquid funds, VCs and retail investors to make confidential transactions on popular dApps (originator wallet and asset value).</p><p><strong>How does KYC (B) attestation work for Hinkal users?</strong></p><p>Before using Hinkal&#8217;s functions, all users must mint an "Access token", obtainable after providing an attestation either with major CEXs/custodians or KYC(B) providers. If there&#8217;s no attestation on hand, users can do KYC(B) on partner KYC(B) protocols or Coinbase/Binance, depending on preference and trust.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How does Hinkal utilize cross-chain communication for KYC(B)?</strong></p><p>Hinkal integrates Axelar&#8217;s secure cross-chain communication to minimize user friction and make the onboarding process seamless. Users can mint all/some of the Access Tokens across networks with a single transaction on their preferred chain.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F266d982f-dcc5-4dfe-a46e-a58bef84e9f1_1600x900.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="819" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F266d982f-dcc5-4dfe-a46e-a58bef84e9f1_1600x900.png" width="1456" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p><strong>How does privacy work?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Hinkal uses a combination of a shielded pool, ZK-Proofs, and stealth addresses to balance privacy with cost-efficiency, transforming the way on-chain trading operates.&nbsp;</p><p>Let&#8217;s dive into specifics.</p><p><strong>Shielded Pool</strong></p><p>When a user connects their wallet to Hinkal, they generate a shielded address. Only the public wallet that created this shielded address can view its balance and spend it. After the user mints their Access Token, they can deposit their assets into Hinkal&#8217;s shielded pool. The shielded pool contains all the assets deposited from users. Every transaction is executed by the relayer on the user&#8217;s behalf and uses the assets deposited to the shielded pool. Hence users can transact confidentially - no direct connection between the public address and the executed transactions.[<a href="https://research.metastate.dev/multi-asset_shielded_pool/">4</a>]</p><p><strong>ZK-Proofs</strong></p><p>A zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) is a cryptographic method used to prove the validity of a statement, without revealing the content of that statement. [<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/explained/zero-knowledge-proofs-explained">5</a>]</p><p>Hinkal uses ZKPs on two occasions:</p><ol><li><p>Proving the ownership of a KYC(B) attestation. ZKPs are used to validate users who completed the process when they provide an attestation.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Every time a user performs a transaction using Hinkal, a commitment of value is created or spent, updating their shielded balance. ZKPs are used to prove that the user has enough funds for the transaction executed and to create new (or nullify) commitments.&nbsp;</p></li></ol><p>Hinkal&#8217;s use of ZKPs allows users not to reveal sensitive information, preserving users' privacy.</p><p><strong>Stealth Addresses</strong></p><p>Stealth addresses are temporary, cryptographically secured addresses generated for each transaction Hinkal users submit. Using stealth addresses, Hinkal can execute transactions with flexible parameters like slippage, cover all associated costs, and refund any difference back to the user. This not only reduces transaction fees but also enhances privacy. Users no longer have to reveal predetermined asset values, ensuring complete anonymity [6].</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>As DeFi advances, one of the key questions for the industry is how to find the right balance between user privacy, capital efficiency, and regulatory compliance. All this, of course, happens under the backdrop of several large institutional players, such as Blackrock, Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton expanding their presence in the crypto space. However, for these big asset holders to fully embrace DeFi, the industry needs to first solve two important issues:</p><ol><li><p>Users should be able to have on-chain assets privately and transact confidentially. No third party should have the ability to link transactions back to them and see all their assets on a public ledger.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Privacy should be immaculate. Effective mechanisms should be in place to ensure that honest users do not associate themselves with illicit parties and funds.</p></li></ol><p>Hinkal satisfies both, as it allows users to obfuscate their assets and transact privately by utilizing its shielded pool, ZKPs, and relayers. At the same time, the requirement for KYC(B) attestations to use the protocol ensures only legitimate parties can access the provided on-chain privacy. Thus, Hinkal&#8217;s solution offers on-chain transactional privacy while staying in line with regulatory requirements. Ultimately it is paving the way for institutional players to enter DeFi that will lead it to its full potential, benefitting the whole ecosystem.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Thanks for reading the Stanford Blockchain Review!

While BTC has been the de-facto store of value, there are numerous technological, institutional, and market catalysts propelling it toward something more productive than just a "lazy" digital gold. In this article, we present our perspectives on the history of innovations &amp; controversies surrounding Bitcoin, the latest initiatives, and Portal's thesis to make Bitcoin more &#8220;capital-efficient&#8221; versus &#8220;programmable&#8221;.</em></p><h1>Introduction</h1><p>We all love pandas. They are adorable and of limited supply due to their<a href="http://www.scijourner.org/2012/04/24/new-light-on-giant-panda-reproduction-problems/"> genetic reproductive problems</a>. They are also excellent stores of value as the most expensive animal in the world, generating an annual &#8220;yield&#8221; of<a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/most-expensive-species-in-captivity"> $1M/panda/year in rental fees</a>.</p><p>Today we keep pandas in zoos, mainly to watch them being cute. There isn't much they can do due to their biological design: they eat bamboo, sleep, defecate, and repeat. And one day, someone came up with an idea: what if we train or genetically modify pandas to make them more useful to our society? Such an innovation would increase world GDP to have panda workers contributing more to the workforce.</p><p><strong>Panda = Bitcoin&nbsp;</strong></p><p>This brings us to an interesting parallel. If we equate pandas with Bitcoin, the concept becomes clear: enhancing pandas' societal utility is akin to increasing Bitcoin&#8217;s programmability, much like the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe2da1c1b-1f19-48c4-b0b3-c55677f3a40b_1308x533.jpeg" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="533" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe2da1c1b-1f19-48c4-b0b3-c55677f3a40b_1308x533.jpeg" width="1308" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>In this article, we explore the unexpected parallel between Bitcoin and Panda to demonstrate our overarching interest in the BTC ecosystem. The article outlines the following:</p><ol><li><p>The &#8220;why&#8221; question, along with the latest catalysts in the Bitcoin ecosystem</p></li><li><p>Our thesis: Evaluating Bitcoin as a capital efficient asset vs. its potential as a programmable platform</p></li><li><p>An analysis of various approaches to Bitcoin&#8217;s productivity</p></li><li><p>Summary of our findings and perspectives</p></li></ol><p>To differentiate the taxonomy in the context of this article, we will use &#8220;BTC&#8221; to represent the digital asset, and &#8220;Bitcoin&#8221; the layer one blockchain network. With the following in mind, let&#8217;s proceed to the first section of our analysis:</p><h1>Section One: Why Bother?</h1><p>The attempt to make BTC more useful than just sitting cold in hard wallets is nothing new. Its<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTC.D/"> glaring dominance</a> has sparked waves of curiosity and endeavors - some stronger than others, and we are currently in the midst of the strongest yet.</p><p>First, let's revisit some popular arguments against making BTC productive:</p><ol><li><p><strong>BTC should be a store of value</strong>, a belief most widely held among some clamorous and unyielding &#8220;BTC OGs,&#8221; but there&#8217;s been a significant shift in community sentiment lately due to catalysts that will be discussed later.</p></li></ol><ol start="2"><li><p><strong>Wrapped BTC (WBTC) has a lukewarm product-market-fit</strong>: WBTC is an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain that represents BTC, backed 1:1 with BTC that&#8217;s held by a centralized custodian, BitGo. The market cap of WBTC is currently approximately <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/wrapped-bitcoin">$5B</a> and topped at approximately $15B, a minuscule fraction of BTC. However, we believe the lackluster WBTC activity level is far from being indicative of the public&#8217;s interest in making BTC more productive. Rather, it only shows that a centralized + EVM-centric approach to BTC is perhaps inadequate.</p></li></ol><ol start="3"><li><p><strong>The Bitcoin chain is not designed for programmability</strong>: Bitcoin's smart contracts are implemented using Script, a programming language that is not Turing-complete, which was a design choice to maximize the security of the network by limiting attack surface (e.g. there&#8217;s no<a href="https://hackernoon.com/hack-solidity-reentrancy-attack"> Reentrancy Attack</a> using the Script language).</p><p></p><p><strong>Contrary to popular belief, the Bitcoin chain does support smart contracts</strong>, although in a more basic form compared to other blockchains such as Ethereum or Solana. Available smart contract types on Bitcoin today include: </p><ol><li><p><strong>Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash (P2PKH)</strong>: This is the most basic Bitcoin smart contract and allows BTC to be sent to an address in a way that only the owner of the corresponding private key can spend the BTC.</p></li><li><p><strong>Multi-Signature Scripts</strong>: This allows multiple parties to hold money cooperatively. For example, we could have 3 people with access to a wallet, and the funds in the wallet can only be traded if 2 out of the 3 people sign a transaction with their public key.</p></li><li><p><strong>Time-Locked BTC Transactions</strong>: These enable us to spend BTC only after a set time has passed. For example, a script could require 3 signatures to spend the BTC before a certain time, after which only 1 signature is required.</p></li><li><p><strong>Pay-to-Script-Hash (P2SH)</strong>: Enables the creation of addresses that can receive or send transactions in which a series of instructions must be followed to unlock the balances in those addresses.</p></li><li><p><strong>Pay-to-Taproot (P2TR)</strong>: Leverages the privacy upgrades from Taproot and provides more flexible mechanisms to authorize transactions.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://river.com/learn/what-are-partially-signed-bitcoin-transactions-psbts/">Partially Signed BTC Transaction</a> (PSBT)</strong>: a Bitcoin standard that facilitates the portability of unsigned transactions, unlocking use cases like offline signing, multi-sig, multi-party transactions.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://unchainedcrypto.com/what-are-discreet-log-contracts-dlcs/">Discreet Log Contracts</a> (DLC)</strong>: a type of Bitcoin transaction that utilizes an oracle to execute smart contracts on the Bitcoin blockchain, enabling two parties to create and execute private agreements off-chain, with the Bitcoin blockchain acting as the final settlement for the agreements.</p></li></ol></li></ol><p>However, questions still remain regarding Bitcoin&#8217;s purpose: should we not simply maintain its role as the store of value that it was intended to be? We have categorized the arguments for BTC&#8217;s enhanced productivity into six categories below:</p><ol><li><p><strong>The lure of liquidity influx into DeFi from BTC</strong></p><p></p><p>BTC has consistently dominated the crypto market with a market share between<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTC.D/"> 40%-70%</a> for the past five years [1]. In contrast, ETH, even with all the thriving L2s and dapps on top, has only reached a market share of<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ETH.D/"> 20% ATH</a> [2].</p><p></p><p>It's simple math: by unlocking just a third of the potential liquidity on BTC, we could theoretically double the size of the DeFi liquidity today. Of course, one should not assume that the liquidity injection into DeFi will be commensurate with the market size of BTC - after all, most BTC holdings belong to institutions unlikely to ever &#8220;degen&#8221; their assets. Such nuances will be discussed later in the article.</p></li><li><p><strong>To counterbalance the erosion of network security from each Bitcoin halving</strong></p><p></p><p>Bitcoin halving refers to the reduction in the reward given to miners for verifying transactions on the network every four years. Currently, the block reward is 6.25 BTC per block, with the next halving being in April 2024. While halving is integral to Bitcoin's design to control its supply, it could potentially impact security in two ways:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Declining number of miners</strong>: halving directly reduces the profitability of mining, leading some miners to shut down their operations if the cost of mining surpasses the rewards.</p></li><li><p><strong>Lowering costs of 51% attack</strong>: the costs to bribe miners to carry out a 51% attack are also cut in half with each halving. This means if someone wants to take a massive short position on BTC, each halving makes the attack &#8220;easier&#8221; as the hash rate falls, the number of miners decreases, and the costs (equivalent to miners&#8217; block reward amount) to bribe miners become cheaper.</p></li></ol><p></p><p>There are two levers to counter this abrasion to the Bitcoin network&#8217;s security budget:</p><p></p><ol><li><p><strong>First lever</strong> (not so reliable): scarcity of BTC total supply pushes up the token price. However, BTC's maximum supply of about 21M is well known and priced in - the real-time price of BTC is much more driven by macro &amp; crypto market sentiment.</p></li><li><p><strong>Second lever</strong> (the point of discussion here): the assumption that fees from increasing network/on-chain activity on the Bitcoin network will grow over time to compensate for the diminishing block rewards. Aside from the Ordinal inscription craze earlier this year, this lever has not been utilized - but this is poised to change.</p></li></ol><p></p><p>Generating demand for Bitcoin&#8217;s blockspace to boost fees to miners is a non-negotiable quest for the longevity &amp; security of the Bitcoin network.</p></li><li><p><strong>Macro Catalysts</strong></p><p></p><p>1.<strong>  12 Spot BTC ETF Filing</strong>: the world&#8217;s largest asset manager, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/BLK:US">BlackRock Inc.</a>, filed an application for a spot BTC ETF in June [3].

UTXO's explicit dependency tracking makes it advantageous for ZKPs by enabling parallelism. In contrast to the account model's sequential execution, UTXO allows for smaller, more manageable computations to be run in parallel.</p></li><li><p>Privacy: The UTXO model improves privacy by ensuring that each UTXO is unique. This makes it more difficult to trace transaction history compared to Ethereum's account model, which is significantly more transparent.</p></li><li><p>Simplified Verification: With UTXOs, verifying transactions is simpler. Each transaction refers to specific UTXOs as inputs and outputs, making it easier for nodes to validate transactions without needing to compute the entire state of the network.</p></li><li><p>Security: The UTXO model offers certain security advantages. In the case of a network compromise or attack, the UTXO model might contain the damage to a specific UTXO, whereas an account-based model could potentially expose a broader account and its associated assets.</p></li><li><p>Atomic Swaps and Smart Contracts: The UTXO model is also suitable for atomic swaps, where transactions on different blockchains can be executed simultaneously. Additionally, while Ethereum's account-based model is more conducive to complex smart contracts due to its Turing complete language, Bitcoin's UTXO model is more effective at executing simpler, more deterministic smart contracts.</p></li></ol><p>5. <strong>There's an insatiable demand for the Bitcoin blockspace that the status quo just cannot support</strong></p><p>During the Ordinal mint craze,<a href="https://infotrend.com/bitcoins-new-frontier-taproot-ordinals-brc-20s-more/#:~:text=With%20the%20Taproot%20upgrade%2C%20the,the%20creation%20of%20Bitcoin%20Ordinals"> Binance had to integrate with the Lightning Network to reduce transfer costs</a> [4].

Similarly, despite its low throughput and limited programmability, Bitcoin (BTC) still stands out as a premier blockchain because of its brand.</p><p>While it may take years for this prediction to materialize, in a future where major layer one blockchains all eventually achieve the Power Law of performance - where incremental speed improvement from a TPS of 100,000 to 5M no longer matters to most customers - how will the largest, most high-end customers choose?

What will be the identity of Bitcoin going forward: a "lazy" digital gold as a store of value, a currency for payments especially in emerging markets, or a programmable and performant layer one?</p><p>In our view, such ambiguity is a feature rather than a bug. The lack of consensus regarding what Bitcoin should be is precisely the catalyst we need to build towards a diverse and vibrant Bitcoin ecosystem, in which we see two diverging schools of innovation: making Bitcoin more <strong>"programmable</strong>" vs. "<strong>capital efficient</strong>."</p><ul><li><p><strong>Making Bitcoin more "programmable"</strong> involves developing Bitcoin towards an Ethereum-like ecosystem. This includes addressing the limitations of Bitcoin's native smart contracts and scaling capabilities (speed &amp; cost-effectiveness). The scope of this development encompasses various verticals, which include:</p><ul><li><p>Interoperability with other chains, such as bridging and EVM integration</p></li><li><p>Complex DeFi and trading features, including swapping, various DEX platforms, synthetic assets, and LSD.</p></li><li><p>Support for Ordinals, BRC-20, and other future token standards.</p></li><li><p>The ability to issue new assets on the Bitcoin chain using specific token standards.</p></li><li><p>Layer 2 solutions that utilize Bitcoin as a data availability layer, such as VM, rollup, and other scaling solutions.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Making BTC more "capital efficient"</strong> involves primarily treating BTC as a store of value and creating basic financial products on top of it. The capital efficient thesis does not prioritize scalability or the versatility of the Bitcoin chain. Instead, it solely focuses on financializing BTC to enable sustainable yields and similarly foundational financial products, thereby increasing BTC's capital efficiency while balancing risks. This approach is a progressive extension of the "BTC as a store of value" ethos. The scope of this thesis includes:</p><ul><li><p>Trustless BTC staking and yields.</p></li><li><p>Native stablecoins on Bitcoin, or BTC-backed stablecoins.</p></li><li><p>Insurance on Bitcoin, either on-chain or off-chain.</p></li><li><p>Solutions to address MEV (Miner Extractable Value) on Bitcoin (currently, transactions frequently get stuck in the mempool if miner fees are low, and there is already MEV frontrunning during the Ordinal mint frenzy).</p></li><li><p>Layer 2 solutions, defined in this context as any scaling solutions that speed up transactions and lower fees on the Bitcoin Network (could include virtual machines, rollups, use Bitcoin as DA, etc.).</p></li></ul></li></ul><p><em>The L2 scaling solution falls into both categories because it serves as the foundational infrastructure that enables Bitcoin to be more programmable and capital-efficient.</em></p><p>Out of the two theses mentioned above, we believe in the latter and are seeking out products that can make BTC more capital-efficient as a digital asset rather than programmable/general-purpose. We have outlined the reasons for such a stance below:</p><ul><li><p><strong>BTC&#8217;s evident product-market-fit as a store of value: </strong>From a ten-thousand-foot view, who has the most definitive product-market-fit across the entire crypto industry? For a native DeFi user, the answer might be Ethereum. But for the non-crypto-native population, it's BTC as a store of value.</p><p></p><p>Why not leverage and expand on this proven PMF as the one and only digital gold, but instead play into others' strengths? After all, there are a plethora of use case-specific solutions (Solana, ETH L2s, new EVM scaling solutions like Monad) outside of the Bitcoin ecosystem that are "genetically" designed to be better suited than the Bitcoin chain for speed and scalability.</p></li><li><p><strong>Source of net-new demand: the DeFi &#8220;non-degens&#8221;: </strong>As we get excited about the possibility of unlocking liquidity from BTC, an important question to consider is: where is this new liquidity coming from? In our opinion, institutional BTC holders and non-crypto-native retail holders are the main contributors. Unlike proficient DeFi users, or the colloquial "degens," both institutions and retail investors have a similarly-low risk appetite and tolerance for complexity.</p><p></p><p>What will be attractive to these new customer segments is the simplicity of BTC products that make their BTC more "capital efficient," and generate sustainable and reliable yield without complicated operations and counterparty risks?</p></li><li><p><strong>Mentality of spending, using, and risking BTCs: </strong>The psychology of transferring BTC is quite different from ETH due to their respective perceptions and characteristics. Realistically, what would it take for someone to transfer their BTC out of their hardware wallet? The most important consideration is security and risk above all else. Enhanced programmability comes with the cost of expanded surface areas of vulnerabilities, which could discourage risk-averse institutional miners and holders from participating.</p></li></ul><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F29015a92-0e99-4269-b46a-7bbbbff9af43_768x768.jpeg" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="442" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F29015a92-0e99-4269-b46a-7bbbbff9af43_768x768.jpeg" width="442" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">WE WANT THIS</figcaption></figure></div><p>To summarize using the panda analogy, our focus is on finding projects that contribute to the reproduction of more baby pandas, rather than altering pandas' DNA.

Activated on-chain in November 2021, the Taproot upgrade made the Bitcoin network more private and secure via Schnorr Signatures (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-taproot-enabled-ordinals-protocol-trust-machines/">BIP 340</a>); more scalable via the introduction of BIP341 - Pay-to-Taproot (P2TR) and Merklized Alternative Script Trees (MAST), and more Programmable via modifying Bitcoin's scripting language to read Schnorr signatures.</p><p>Enabled by the Taproot upgrade, various groups of developers have emerged with their own ideologies regarding the future of Bitcoin. These new initiatives exist alongside the latest advancements from more established and long-standing innovators such as STX and Lightning Labs. We have grouped the eight major "tribes" in the Bitcoin ecosystem as follows:</p><p>1.<strong> Stacks Ecosystem (STX)</strong></p><p>We have been tracking the STX ecosystem for over a year at this point.

While many other major tokens will still undergo the battle with the SEC to fight off the "security token" label, STX has achieved sufficient decentralization like Ethereum did in 2017 and will not have to be distracted by legal fights going forward.</p></li><li><p>Tokenomics (again, not financial advice, data as of Nov 27, 2023): As the dominant Bitcoin L2 on the liquid market, STX is at**~$1.2B** FDV (Fully Diluted Valuation) compared to more recent Ethereum L2s: Celestia $5.5B FDV, Optimism $7.4B FDV, Arbitrum $10B FDV. Don&#8217;t forget, BTC market cap is more than 2-3x that of ETH.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, STX&#8217;s vesting schedule (78% vested) - a major source of inflation by releasing additional token supply into the circulating - is on par with mature projects such as Solana (~<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/solana">75</a>%), as contrasted with other newer chains such as Arbitrum (~13% vested), Optimism (~20% vested) and Celestia (~15% vested).</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Major ecosystem catalysts</strong>: there are two upcoming ecosystem upgrades -<a href="https://stacks.org/sbtc-nakamoto"> Nakamoto Upgrade &amp; sBTC</a>, slated to launch in early 2024 [7].</p><ul><li><p><strong>Officially becoming a Bitcoin L2 via the Nakamoto upgrade</strong>: post the Nakamoto upgrade, STX will inherit 100% of BTC&#8217;s hash power for the security of transactions (reorg resistance) on the Stacks network. This upgrade also marks Stacks&#8217; transition from a sidechain to an L2 on BTC.

While it's trust-minimized (via multi-sig) versus completely trustless, it's as good as any solution on the market without changing the BTC ops codes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Becoming interoperable via EVM &amp; Rust-VM subnets</strong>: a common critique of the STX ecosystem has been its lack of interoperability because of Clarity (its programming language). Post Nakamoto upgrade, Stacks will introduce new subnets that could support other programming languages and execution environments, such as EVM subnets and Rust VM. Further, there is already work on WASM support directly at Stacks L2, which will go live with the Nakamoto upgrade, opening the doors to other languages like Rust, Solidity, etc., directly at the Stacks L2 level.</p></li></ul></li></ul><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2416718f-14a0-4d34-a671-f6f10e0888de_583x316.jpeg" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="316" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2416718f-14a0-4d34-a671-f6f10e0888de_583x316.jpeg" width="583" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">From<a href="https://flagship.fyi/outposts/bitcoin-economy/everything-you-need-to-know-about-stacks-nakamoto-upgrade/"> https://flagship.fyi/outposts/bitcoin-economy/everything-you-need-to-know-about-stacks-nakamoto-upgrade/</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>2.<strong> The &#8220;NFTs&#8221; and beyond:</strong> Ordinals, BRC-20, and other new standards</p><p>On November 7th, 2023, Binance listed the Ordinals (ORDI) BRC-20 token, which reached over $100M in 24-hour training volume.

Indeed, the increased data storage requirements for miners to run a full Bitcoin node (see charts above) have increased dramatically since Ordinals.

Unlike other P2P protocols, which often lack a global ID system, Urbit provides a default schelling point for identity. In contrast to existing Bitcoin identity solutions that are simple but limited, L2 node implementations on Urbit come equipped with a shared identity system for recognizing, connecting with, and exchanging information with peers. This eliminates the need for bespoke integration and allows applications to interact seamlessly across different protocols, reducing the complexity associated with managing distinct identity formats and node RPC solutions. With Urbit, developers benefit from a baseline of integrated addressability, key compromise resilience, non-spam credibility, and the ability to maintain consistent identities across various applications and network layers.

The latest new solution,<a href="https://bitvm.org/bitvm.pdf"> BitVM by Robin Linus</a>, although still in its infancy, seems to be a significant advancement. BitVM represents the initial step towards enabling Turing-complete Bitcoin contracts without modifying the ops code [11]. The main innovations in BitVM include:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Introducing State</strong> across different UTXOs or different scripts using Bit Commitments</p></li><li><p><strong>Verifiability through Logic Gates</strong>: executions can be verified by de-constructing any program in question in the virtual machine and verifying the validity of execution by the prover. This ensures that any false claims can be quickly disproven</p></li><li><p><strong>Keeping Bitcoin Network Lightweight</strong>: Similar to an Optimistic Rollup on Ethereum, BitVM doesn't execute extensive computations on Bitcoin. Rather, it minimizes the scope of the on-chain footprint to just disproving incorrect executions, functioning more as a solver and verifier. Only the output of the BitVM program is used in the Bitcoin transaction.</p></li></ol><p>While the functionality of BitVM is extremely limited today - with only one workable function called the<a href="https://x.com/bitoordileone/status/1712497318115651901?s=20"> Zero Checking function</a> - potential use cases in the future include two-way pegs with side chains for scalability. If a ZK verifier can be built in BitVM, then roll-ups on Bitcoin can be enabled without a soft fork. Here is a good<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxqQU6j6jI8"> listen</a> on<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@StephanLivera"> Stephan Livera</a>&#8217;s podcast.</p><p>6.<strong> Lightning Network</strong>: It is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Bitcoin (BTC) that utilizes payment channels to combine on-chain settlement and off-chain processing. This approach aims to accelerate and reduce the costs of BTC transactions. The Lightning Network exhibits characteristics akin to an "app" chain designed specifically for payment use cases, distinguishing it from broader scope Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum on Ethereum.</p><p>The network has enjoyed impressive growth of<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-lightning-network-growth-surges-over-two-years"> 1212%</a> over the last two years with a TVL of about <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-core-developer-antoine-riard-steps-back-lightning-network-dilemma">$160M</a> at the time of writing [12] [13]. However, the off-chain component also brings its unique challenges such as<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-core-developer-antoine-riard-steps-back-lightning-network-dilemma"> Replacement Cycling Attacks</a> threatening the network.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.bitcoininsider.org/article/222431/why-bitcoin-needs-smart-contracts">The drawbacks</a></strong>: Lightning Network is not entirely trustless as it requires peer-to-peer payment channels with sufficient liquidity and constant online presence. There's a risk of unilateral channel closures when users go offline, potentially resulting in intercepted funds. Congestion in these channels can expose the network to fraud and attacks.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c998ca2-c456-449a-8e38-06a57904f3a2_1023x552.jpeg" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="552" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c998ca2-c456-449a-8e38-06a57904f3a2_1023x552.jpeg" width="1023" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>7. <strong>Digital asset insurance on BTC</strong></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://docs.lightning.engineering/the-lightning-network/taproot-assets">Taproot Assets</a>: Taproot-powered protocol for issuing assets on the Bitcoin blockchain &amp; works with Lightning Network for speedy &amp; low-cost transactions.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.rgbfaq.com/faq/what-is-rgb">RGB</a>: client-side validated state and smart contracts system operating on Layer 2&amp;3 of the Bitcoin ecosystem.

<div> 关键词：DePIN、物理基础设施、分布式网络、token激励、区块链生态

总结:<br />文章探讨了DePIN（去中心化物理基础设施网络）的概念和其在区块链领域的应用。DePIN项目如Arweave、Filecoin和Helium旨在通过集体所有权、分布式成本和经济规模效应，利用区块链技术改造物理基础设施。核心原理是通过token激励机制驱动用户参与，形成一个自我扩展的生态系统。文章以Helium和Hivemapper为例，展示了这些项目的机会与挑战，如Token激励的可持续性问题以及链上与链下融合的趋势。DePIN的崛起对区块链生态产生了影响，推动了高性能链的需求，同时也影响着去中心化治理的扩展，可能将DAO的管理范畴从数字资产扩展到实物资产。 <div>

The core promise of DePIN is to bring the principles of blockchain applications &#8211; as community owned, publicly verifiable, and incentive-aligned &#8211; to the world of physical &#8220;things&#8221; and infrastructure, whether that is WiFi stations, security cameras, or computation servers. Within this article, we will look at some of the core principles of DePIN, before exploring some of the most representative DePIN projects, and finally discussing some of DePIN&#8217;s wider implications on the blockchain space.</p><h2>Conceptualizing DePIN</h2><p>DePIN encompasses a broad variety of projects. From decentralized storage networks such as Arweave and Filecoin to decentralized WiFi connectivity such as Helium, to community-sourced software applications such as Hivemapper, all of these have been characterized as &#8220;DePIN&#8221;. Messari makes this observation in their seminal DePIN report in January 2023, which categorizes DePIN into 4 primary sectors: <strong>decentralized server, wireless, sensor, and energy networks</strong> [2].</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F391f4607-e294-4c4b-b271-63c45b57ab3b_1280x756.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="756" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F391f4607-e294-4c4b-b271-63c45b57ab3b_1280x756.png" width="1280" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p><em>Source: Messari [2]. Retrieved Nov 11, 2023.</em></p><p>From the projects and sectors that Messari delineates, we can see that the original definition of DePIN leans heavily into the &#8220;physical&#8221; nature of projects &#8211; the physical use of sensors, servers, and routers to create a decentralized Internet stack from the hardware layer upwards. Since then, however, this common notion of DePIN has gradually broadened to include more consumer-facing applications, such as TRIP which aims to build a &#8220;decentralized Uber&#8221; [3]. This therefore raises the question: how do we begin to conceptualize what &#8220;DePIN&#8221; refers to?</p><p>Our first task, therefore, is to notice the conceptual similarities between these broad range of projects, in both the original Messari report as well as how this term has gradually evolved. Many of these projects share several similarities, including collective ownership, distributed infrastructure cost, gradually expanding economies of scale as more users enter the ecosystem [4]. Indeed, this can be summarized in Messari&#8217;s DePIN flywheel, explaining how this is facilitated through token incentives.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F97af1377-2bfc-4fa4-9a6a-09395e5ec8e7_1080x609.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="609" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F97af1377-2bfc-4fa4-9a6a-09395e5ec8e7_1080x609.png" width="1080" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p><em>Source: Messari [2]. Retrieved Nov 11, 2023.</em></p><p>The DePIN flywheel above was originally conceived only to encompass &#8220;physical infrastructure&#8221; networks, such as Filecoin and Helium, where users provide resources for the network (disk space, or WiFi connectivity), in return receive token rewards, and in turn allowing the network to have more capacity and attract more users [5] [6].</p><p>However, this flywheel is not limited to hardware infrastructure;<strong> there is also an analogous argument for data infrastructure.</strong> This would encompass projects&#8217; whose central focus is on the collection and coordination of consumer data, using the blockchain and tokens as a common interface to coordinate a new data-based economy. Examples of this would include both consumer-facing applications, such as the &#8220;sensor network projects&#8221; that Messari notes and projects like a &#8220;decentralized Uber,&#8221; as well as potentially enterprise-facing use-cases of blockchain in supply chain or logistics management (although here, there would be much less focus on the financialization of the token).</p><p><strong>Thus, one possible way to conceptualize DePIN as a trend may be the merging of a decentralized hardware layer with a community-owned new data economy.</strong></p><h2>Case Studies in DePIN</h2><p>Given this general characterization of DePIN, we can now explore some of the most characteristic projects within this sector [7].</p><h3>Helium</h3><p><a href="https://www.helium.com/">Helium</a> is one of the oldest and most prominent DePIN projects, starting in 2013 as a company aiming to expand broadband infrastructure through having users deploy LoRa gateways in a decentralized fashion [8]. In 2017, the network decided to capture the momentum around cryptocurrency and begin offering cryptocurrency payments through its own L1 blockchain network [8].</p><p>Over the years, this approach has made Helium not only one of the poster childs of DePIN, but more broadly of the crypto industry [9]. Many dubbed it the &#8220;People&#8217;s Network,&#8221; as it was a major project where one could clearly see how a token could be used to incentivize socially beneficial behavior [10]. However, as time went on, both the Helium network and the protocol suffered from liquidity and adoption issues, and weekly revenues for the network have been facing a steady decline [7]. Critics have also pointed out the use-case for the network has been overblown, and that the incentives are not sustainable [11].</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f0a59e9-df4c-47cb-93ad-0cb622e717e9_1537x604.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="572" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f0a59e9-df4c-47cb-93ad-0cb622e717e9_1537x604.png" width="1456" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p><em>Data retrieved from Coinmarketcap for Feb 2022-March 2023, Accessed Nov 2023. [7]</em></p><p>In April 2023, the Helium completed its transition from its own L1 blockchain to become an application on Solana [12], a move that it hopes would enhance coverage and liquidity of its users, as well as leverage Solana&#8217;s high transaction throughput to scale [13].</p><p>This example of Helium thus highlights both some of the key opportunities and risks within the DePIN space. Tokens can be extremely effective in kickstarting behavior for real-world use cases, yet it is quite difficult to maintain sufficient justification and levels of interest over extended periods of time. Moreover, as L1s and L2s gradually consolidate, it is harder to justify an argument to run an independent chain rather than tap into the scalability, infrastructure, and liquidity of another more broadly adopted chain.</p><h3>Hivemapper</h3><p><a href="https://hivemapper.com/explorer">Hivemapper</a> is another prominent DePIN project on the Solana network that seeks to create a decentralized &#8220;Google Maps&#8221; [14]. Essentially, the project&#8217;s users install dashcams in their cars and share live footage with Hivemapper to receive HONEY tokens in return [14]. The company then uses all of this distributed data to build up a decentralized map with an API interface for applications [15].</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F836a1419-98b0-469e-b816-c5868f7109d2_1600x871.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="793" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F836a1419-98b0-469e-b816-c5868f7109d2_1600x871.png" width="1456" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p><em>Source: Hivemapper Dashboard, as of Nov 11 2023: <a href="https://hivemapper.com/explorer">https://hivemapper.com/explorer</a>&nbsp;</em></p><p>The key advantage that Hivemapper holds over Google Maps is that as a decentralized, token-incentivized network, it is able to complete the token mapping process in a far cheaper and faster way. In turn, Hivemapper is able to offer cheaper APIs as a way to &#8220;break&#8221; Google Maps&#8217; monopoly [15].</p><p>Hivemapper highlights the core &#8220;flywheel&#8221; principle of DePIN, where we use a token to carry out a distributed, decentralized task in an efficient way. Interestingly, within the original Messari report (Jan 2023), Messari characterizes Hivemapper as a prime example of a &#8220;sensor network&#8221; [2]. However, one could argue that this does not adequately capture Hivemapper&#8217;s true innovation.</p><p>Indeed, Hivemapper&#8217;s core competitiveness is in the <strong>data infrastructure</strong> that it gathers &#8211; decentralized data from its network of users &#8211; then monetizing that data infrastructure through providing an API access. Granted, the project uses sensors and dashcams to gather that data; but this is just a contingency. We can imagine that the same overall model might hold true even if this data was not generated by a &#8220;sensor network,&#8221; but through other activities, such as browsing (like the Brave Browser), or even generated by users interacting with artificial intelligence. DePIN uses token incentives to generate mass data through a decentralized way (such as through a decentralized hardware network), <strong>thus creating a new data economy.</strong></p><h3>Teleport</h3><p>This importance of a new data economy is more evident in the case of <a href="https://www.teleport.xyz/">Teleport</a>, a decentralized Uber rival on Solana [3]. With its recent app launch (Oct 2023) and participation at Solana&#8217;s Breakpoint conference [16], Teleport is a crucial part of &#8220;The Rideshare Protocol&#8221; (TRIP) which seeks to create a fair and independent marketplace without an intermediary or centralized frontend taking a significant (often upwards of 40%) portion of a ride&#8217;s revenue [17].</p><p>Although the adoption and staying power of Teleport and TRIP remains to be seen, Teleport is an important case study in showing the importance of an open and decentralized &#8220;data marketplace&#8221; being a core part of DePIN projects&#8217; value propositions.</p><h3>IoTeX</h3><p><a href="https://iotex.io/">IoTeX</a> is another key player within the DePIN space that highlights a different dimension of how blockchain technologies coupled with decentralized hardware devices can have social benefits, namely, the dimension of security and privacy [18]. IoTeX&#8217;s flagship offering has been the <a href="https://ucam.iotex.io/privacy">Ucam</a>, which is a home security camera that only the user themselves can access, with data secured through the cryptographic and immutable properties of the blockchain [19].</p><p>As the overall trend of DePIN has grown within the past year, IoTeX aims to move beyond building particular smart-devices to building an &#8220;open network&#8221; of IoT devices and popularize the concept of &#8220;MachineFi&#8221; [20]. However, as the tale of Helium has shown, under the overall backdrop of a consolidating L1 scene, it is increasingly difficult to make the case for an independent and specialized network and bootstrap the liquidity in such an ecosystem, even if DePIN presents a strong consumer use case and application layer for the blockchain.</p><h2>Broader Ecosystem Impact</h2><p>The growth of DePIN over the past year has considerable impact and implications on the overall blockchain ecosystem. One of the most important reasons for this is that DePIN is a consumer-facing application layer, much like DeFi, gaming, and social, that has the potential for mass adoption and the potential to drive consumer demand for an underlying chain or ecosystem.</p><p>As shown through the examples above, Solana seems to be a chain with significant activity in the DePIN space, and there are other actors such as IoTeX that seek to build novel, alternate solutions customized for DePIN. As an application layer that interacts with mass users and IoT devices, there will likely be a demand for highly performant and composable chains &#8211; ones that can carry the load demand of mass consumers, as well as ones that are composable in general-purpose languages such as Rust and WebAssembly that can be easily run on IoT devices.</p><p>Moreover, the growth of the DePIN trend also has a downstream effect on decentralized governance. As it is fairly customary to launch a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) coordinated by token-based voting after launching a token, many prominent DePIN projects seem to have DAO governance on their roadmaps [21].&nbsp;</p><p>Most of the most notable DAOs right now, such as Uniswap, Compound, and MakerDAO, however, deal almost exclusively with digital or financialized assets. But as DePIN projects mature and transition their gradually handoff their governance to DAOs, there will be an increasing demand for DAOs to coordinate the purchase, use, and maintenance of physical devices, whether that be servers, sensors, or hard drives. Thus, DePIN could potentially be a trend that expand DAOs&#8217; governance mandates from digital to physical assets, ultimately creating tasks that may require DAOs to operate and behave much more like traditional corporations. And in the long run, this could be a turning point marking &#8220;web3&#8217;s&#8221; adoption in &#8220;the real world&#8221; [1].</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Thanks for reading Stanford Blockchain Review!

Throughout my career as a professional artist, I've achieved many milestones, from selling out shows, to showcasing works alongside the legendary Andy Warhol, collaborating with multi-billion dollar companies, exhibiting in prestigious museums, and acquiring some of the most high-profile art collectors in the world. My journey into the &#8220;degen&#8221; world of crypto has been nothing short of a whirlwind. So here&#8217;s a story of how I, as a contemporary artist, found my way into a &#8220;pixel wonderland&#8221; of crypto art and NFTs.</p><h1>NFTs and Pixel Bricks</h1><p>I&#8217;ve worked with a diverse range of media in the art world, and before crypto, I was primarily known for my block and pixel style works, creating both 2D pieces as well as 3D sculptures. In particular, I loved using lego as a medium to recreate the lively-colored, high-contrast, block-art style characteristic of Warhol and other pop artists. The craft of masonry has been a longstanding tradition in my family, and the utilization of blocks as a medium for artistic expression resonated with me, providing an infinite canvas for my creativity.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca29a3d5-623b-4a79-a2f4-31c736b1ceb0_1600x1230.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="1119" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca29a3d5-623b-4a79-a2f4-31c736b1ceb0_1600x1230.png" width="1456" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Image Source [1]</figcaption></figure></div><p>When I first encountered the world of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), I was immediately drawn to the pixelated style of artwork in popular collections such as CryptoPunks. Pixels were just like lego: they offered a way to create a distinctive style that aligned perfectly with my artistic vision. These block-art NFTs encapsulated the vivid, brightly-colored cyberpunk and pop-art aesthetic I had pursued all my career, and combined it with cutting-edge blockchain technology to create a novel medium for digital art. And so, I decided to take on NFTs as a new avenue of artistic expression.</p><h1>Becoming an NFT Artist</h1><p>In May 2021, I launched my first NFT art collection, &#8220;Byte Candy&#8221; that featured digital representations of candy block hearts, each with its own color pattern and signature phrase [x]. Though these pieces of &#8220;candy&#8221; weren&#8217;t edible, these digital pieces gained great traction, selling almost as swiftly as I could produce them, one by one.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6db96160-e61a-42bc-be1c-ff7399ceca65_1600x835.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="760" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6db96160-e61a-42bc-be1c-ff7399ceca65_1600x835.png" width="1456" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>My &#8220;Byte Candy&#8221; collection on OpenSea. Image Source, as of Nov 2023 [2]</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>My artistic experiments with NFTs quickly gained traction within the NFT community. Much to my surprise, I quickly gained over 250,000 NFT enthusiasts with my new crypto-related social media content, and these digital collections became a new source of income for me as a creator. All this caught the eye of leading media outlets such as <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/nft-crypto-scams-how-to-not-get-scammed-1286614/">Rolling Stone</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/05/technology/nft-nyc-metaverse.html">The New York Times</a>, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/lego-artist-jessica-ewud-launched-nft-collection-successful-business-2022-1">Business Insider</a>, and the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/dailymailtv/index.html?vid=2455829">Daily Mail</a>, who became fascinated with how I, as an artist and a creator, stumbled upon the hubbub of the crypto space and began using NFTs as a new means of artistic expression.</p><p>As my audience grew within the web3 space, I began to experiment with a wider range of digital art &#8211; from launching my NFTS into space (via Blue Origin) to building web3 gaming tournaments. In line with my vision throughout my artistic career, each of my collections contains a unique twist and an avant-garde element. One of my favorite collections was an NFT that had the ability to disappear, entitled &#8220;Ghosted.&#8221; Perhaps the most important part of using NFTs as a medium is that it allows creators like myself to have a large space of digital experimentation, as well as a form of ownership over digital art that was previously hard to maintain.</p><h2>Building Trust</h2><p>Interestingly, one of my biggest realizations as an NFT artist is the extent to which trust, brand, and identity matters for a creator in web3. Throughout my journey in the space, I&#8217;ve consciously &#8220;doxxed&#8221; myself as a public persona, as a way to increase a sense of trust and identity between myself and collectors of my artwork. When I collaborate with other creators and projects, I also generally look for publicly &#8220;doxxed&#8221; teams to verify the authenticity of these creators [3].</p><p>Even if the end goal of the space is to establish &#8220;trustlessness,&#8221; trust is still necessary as a component in onboarding people into Web3. Blockchain technology is still in its early stages, and I believe that as an artist and creator, one of my other roles is to educate broader audiences on the nuances of the spaces, using my personal experiences as a springboard to decrease the barrier of entry.</p><p>Looking back, the growth and popularity of my digital art pieces in the crypto world remains one of my most surreal experiences. When I first stepped into the space, I could never have imagined becoming overwhelmed by all the responses and inquiries into my journey into blockchain art. Oftentimes, people ask how I&#8217;ve made it this far as a digital artist. My response is always simple: just like in all fields of art, stay true to your unique artistic vision, and don&#8217;t be afraid to push boundaries.</p><h2>Becoming a Multichain Creator</h2><p>One of these boundaries I&#8217;ve pushed is to expand beyond Ethereum and create digital art for a wide variety of blockchain ecosystems. By minting NFT collections across Bitcoin, Polygon, BNB and the XRP Ledger, I&#8217;ve tried to engage a much broader audience with my artwork, as well as gradually explore the varying &#8220;personalities&#8221; of each chain.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff48ccfb3-6b89-4d0d-90d4-53b0fb444ac2_1600x910.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="828" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff48ccfb3-6b89-4d0d-90d4-53b0fb444ac2_1600x910.png" width="1456" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>&#8220;Space Mermaids&#8221; game on XRP. Image Source [4].</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>Every ecosystem became almost like a different digital gallery, highlighting different themes within my artwork as well as different parts of the community&#8217;s identity. For example, I was fortunate to be selected as one of the winners of the Ripple&#8217;s $250MM Creator Fund, and created &#8220;Space Mermaids,&#8221; an NFT-based interactive game on the XRP ledger that quickly gained popularity and topped the charts at #1 within 24 hours of launch [4].</p><p>Another benefit of embracing a multi-chain approach to digital creation is that it allowed me to stay &#8220;ahead&#8221; of the curve, and quickly adapt to cutting edge developments. For example, I first heard of the idea of creating art on the Bitcoin blockchain at Art Basel in 2022. I was debuting my latest digital series, &#8220;Foil Story,&#8221; when it caught the eye of Bitcoin enthusiasts [5]. There, I began to learn about tokenized art on Bitcoin in the form of &#8220;ordinal&#8221; inscriptions &#8211; which would become the defining digital art trend of the upcoming year. Mastering this inscribing process proved to be a lot more complex than Ethereum smart contracts, and took me a whopping 40 hours of dedication. The resulting creations were a series of 5 ordinals, dating back as far as inscription 52,924 [6]. Now, with over 35 million ordinals inscribed to date, I am proud to be a pioneer as one of the first artists to lead this new trending movement.</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>As an artist constantly exploring novel mediums of creation, blockchain art represents the frontier of creative expression. Granted, exploring opportunities for artists within the blockchain space has its fair share of challenges. The learning curve was steep, and identifying the right audience while conceiving innovative concepts to showcase my work was imperative. Moreover, despite serving as an open-source platform for transparency, the space often seemed to harbor traditional gatekeeping reminiscent of the conventional art world, whether it be in the form of gender divides or technical divides.</p><p>Yet, amidst these challenges, I remain optimistic in the role of art and digital creators playing an increasingly important role in the web3 space. Art, regardless of its medium, is ultimately about a form of empowerment: a process of recognizing, challenging, and changing the world as we know it to push out towards a better future. And it is precisely this sense of empowerment that I hope that blockchain art seeks to create in the long-run, using novel technologies as mediums to push forward the boundaries of expression, creation, and innovation.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Thanks for reading the Stanford Blockchain Review!

This requires no changes to the network&#8217;s consensus rules. Rather than executing computations on Bitcoin, they are merely verified, similar to optimistic rollups. A prover makes a claim that a given function evaluates for some particular inputs to some specific output. If that claim is false, then the verifier can perform a succinct fraud proof and punish the prover. Using this mechanism, any computable function can be verified on Bitcoin.</em></p><p><em>Committing to a large program in a Taproot address requires significant amounts of off-chain computation and communication, however the resulting on-chain footprint is minimal. As long as both parties collaborate, they can perform arbitrarily complex, stateful off-chain computation, without leaving any trace in the chain. On-chain execution is required only in case of a dispute. </em>[1]</p></blockquote><p>Though it might be hard to distill from the abstract above, BitVM marks a paradigm shift in what we thought was possible on Bitcoin. In this article, I&#8217;ll walk you through what BitVM enables and why it&#8217;s a game changer for the Bitcoin ecosystem.&nbsp;</p><h2>Chess, Programs, &amp; Smart Contract Languages</h2><p>Put simply, the BitVM allows arbitrary computation to be executed on Bitcoin. &#8220;Arbitrary computation&#8221; is a mouthful though, and it doesn&#8217;t really help a non-technical reader. So let me give you an example: Chess.</p><p>Chess is an example of a well-defined program with set constraints and a win condition. You have certain pieces that can move in certain ways around an 8x8 board. You know the game is over when a king is captured or neither player is able to win. You can consider chess a program with some arbitrary computation (e.g. there is not a chess.move_knight(F4) command built into Bitcoin).</p><p>Now let&#8217;s say Vicky and Paul want to play a game of chess against each other. What&#8217;s more, they want to make a big bet on it: 1 BTC to the winner! Given this game has such large stakes, they want a way to verify who won.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4933aadb-561e-4315-9d8b-6fd15826023b_880x898.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="898" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4933aadb-561e-4315-9d8b-6fd15826023b_880x898.png" width="880" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>"Vicky And Paul Playing Chess In A Magical World Where The Winner Gets A Lot Of Bitcoin" - StarryAI</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>Before blockchains, Vicky &amp; Paul&#8217;s best bet was to find a trusted third party (let&#8217;s call him Terrance) who would observe the game, declare a winner, and custody/pay out the 1 BTC. But what if Terrance wasn&#8217;t so trustworthy? Maybe Terrance decides to run away and keep the 1 BTC for himself. Maybe Paul bribed Terrance to declare him the winner no matter what. Neither of these situations (or the myriad of others that could potentially arise) are ideal.</p><p>Enter blockchains! A primary advantage of blockchains is that they shift the need to trust another human to the need to trust cryptography and code.</p><p>So why don&#8217;t we see an on-chain chess game on Bitcoin like we <a href="https://betterprogramming.pub/on-chain-chess-smart-contract-breakdown-7d01cdaaeb54">do on Ethereum</a> {1}[2]? The answer lies in Bitcoin&#8217;s underlying language: <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script">Script</a> [3].</p><h2>Bitcoin Script</h2><p>As an analogy, think of Bitcoin/Script like your high-school calculator and Ethereum/Solidity like your iPhone (or Android if you&#8217;re like me). Your iPhone can run any program an app developer can cook up. Your calculator, on the other hand, is limited to some numbers and a few mathematical functions. Maybe there are a few extra buttons for some calculus on there, but no one is mistaking your TI-83 for an iPhone, even if it can draw fancy graphs.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6d12a8ec-f9a4-4dff-8ffd-58af878de867_1600x895.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="Script calculator buttons (left) vs. Solidity functional code (right)" class="sizing-normal" height="814" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6d12a8ec-f9a4-4dff-8ffd-58af878de867_1600x895.png" title="Script calculator buttons (left) vs. Solidity functional code (right)" width="1456" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>Script calculator buttons (left) vs. Solidity code (right)</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>Ethereum&#8217;s smart contract language, Solidity, is considered &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness#:~:text=In%20colloquial%20usage%2C%20the%20terms,purpose%20computer%20or%20computer%20language.">Turing complete</a>&#8221; [4]. While this isn&#8217;t strictly true, it&#8217;s used in this context to mean Solidity can run pretty much any program imaginable. Chess, a Defi protocol, a zero-knowledge proof verifier - these can all be implemented directly on Ethereum.</p><p>Script, however, is not considered Turing complete. This means it wasn&#8217;t possible to run all those cool programs you see on other chains on Bitcoin (until now!). Within Script, there is a list of &#8220;opcodes&#8221;. These are essentially the buttons of the Bitcoin calculator. You&#8217;ll see opcodes for simple things like addition (OP_ADD) and cryptographic operations like hashing (OP_SHA256).</p><p>There are ~100 opcodes on Bitcoin, and they are specifically designed to limit the complexity of the computation that can be done. For example, as of writing there is not an opcode to multiply two numbers, nor is there an opcode to add to strings together. Satoshi removed these and many other opcodes very early in Bitcoin&#8217;s life due to network safety concerns.</p><h2>Bitcoin Nodes &amp; Avoiding Arbitrarily Long Compute</h2><p>So why did Satoshi make Bitcoin so restrictive? The answer lies in the economics of Bitcoin. Bitcoin&#8217;s security relies on decentralization. It relies on users like you and me to run nodes and VERIFY that the transactions submitted to the network are valid. A full node runs the computation of every transaction in every block on the network. And unlike Ethereum, the fee a user must pay to get their transaction included is only loosely related to the amount of computation required to execute the transaction {2}.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a5677d1-a9ef-4ab8-99a2-85a1c7704b02_1600x1044.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="This transaction from 2015 required 5,569 signatures to be validated.

That would effectively be a DDoS on the Bitcoin network! Nodes are expected to verify a block in a timely manner because miners can&#8217;t add a new block until the previous one is verified. By restricting the language of Bitcoin, Satoshi ensured the amount of computation required for a node to verify a block would never spiral out of control.</p><p>This is where BitVM comes into play. What <a href="https://twitter.com/robin_linus?lang=en">Robin</a> and the clever team at <a href="https://zerosync.org/">ZeroSync</a> have figured out is a way to allow those arbitrary programs to be executed on Bitcoin without making every full node run every line in the program.</p><p>BitVM achieves this through some crazy wizardry. First it simulates <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_gate">Boolean logic gates</a> (the building block of computers) within Script [5]. Then, it uses something called hashlocks and the structure of Taproot addresses to verify the arbitrary computation. Finally, through an elegant challenge protocol, the Bitcoin network can adjudicate which party (Paul or Vicky in our example) is correct [6].</p><h2>What does BitVM enable?</h2><p>With all that background knowledge out of the way, we&#8217;re brought back to BitVM. BitVM has created a way to verify arbitrary computation on Bitcoin. Very simply, before BitVM, Paul Paul and Vicky couldn&#8217;t have played their chess game and had the result verified by Bitcoin. But now they can!</p><p>BitVM will allow them to deposit 0.5 BTC each into a 2/2 multisig address that they both control. If they both agree that Vicky won, they both sign a transaction that sends the 1 BTC to Vicky. Easy peasy! If they disagree, however, there is a way to verify every chess move that happened on Bitcoin and force Paul to send Vicky the 1 BTC. This is what makes BitVM so special.</p><p>While <a href="https://github.com/mcbagz/LogicGates/blob/main/Example.ipynb">chess is a cool example</a>, the design space on BitVM is limitless. It will allow users to verify that almost any program ran correctly all directly on Bitcoin! We&#8217;re just a few weeks in, and we&#8217;re already seeing strong groups <a href="https://github.com/supertestnet/tapleaf-circuits">hacking away on toy programs</a> to test out this new system.</p><p>As for me, I&#8217;m most excited about the potential for BitVM to: (1) enable trust-minimized bridges, and (2) verify zero-knowledge proofs. These are the two key components of a Zero Knowledge (ZK) rollup {3}.&nbsp;</p><p>Up until now, zkRollups haven&#8217;t been built on Bitcoin because there was no way to trustlessly get BTC from the main chain to the rollup, nor to verify zkProofs. With BitVM, we just may be able to do both!</p><p>If BitVM can supercharge Bitcoin to enable zkRollups, a new era of fully on-chain Bitcoin applications is about to explode. Defi, DAOs, gaming, etc. will all be coming to Bitcoin &#8211; and this is the true promise that BitVM holds [7].</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Thanks for reading the Stanford Blockchain Review!

Want to run through 1 million iterations of a &#8220;for&#8221; loop? No problem! The nodes will get started on that right away. But if you hit your gas limit at iteration 756,203 - the network will just stop executing your program. You still paid all that gas, but you never got a result. On Bitcoin, the fee paid to the network is for the guarantee that your transaction will be executed on all nodes. Thus, bitcoin has no way to self-regulate based on how much work you are asking nodes to do. For example, the signature hashing algorithm used on Bitcoin is very inefficient. One surly Bitcoiner decided to submit a transaction that <a href="https://mempool.space/tx/bb41a757f405890fb0f5856228e23b715702d714d59bf2b1feb70d8b2b4e3e08">required 5,569 signatures to be validated</a>, and it took nodes over a minute to validate!

As the blockchain space continues to mature, there is a great need to bridge this developer gap and allow for a much more composable web3 development.</p><p>Within this article, we will introduce Offchain Labs&#8217; latest project, Arbitrum Stylus, unveiled at the Blockchain Applications Stanford Summit (BASS) conference during Stanford Blockchain Week. Arbitrum Stylus is a landmark project that aims to create a new standard for smart contract composability through unifying the execution environment of the EVM with that of WASM. First, we will discuss some of the motivations behind this project, before diving into some of the project&#8217;s implementation details, and finally discussing the project&#8217;s impact in the web3 space.</p><h2>Motivation for Arbitrum Stylus</h2><p>Arbitrum Stylus was developed to address two key problems in blockchain development: (1) the accessibility of blockchain development, and (2) the executional efficiency of smart contracts.</p><h3>Making Blockchain Development more Accessible</h3><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc9829c1e-fb72-4705-991e-e252905cc016_1092x810.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="471.0164835164835" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc9829c1e-fb72-4705-991e-e252905cc016_1092x810.png" width="635" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>Developer Report by Electric Capital. Image from Source [1]. Retrieved Oct 20 2023.</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>According to Electric Capital&#8217;s Developer Report, there are currently around 20,000 monthly active blockchain developers [1]. Although this number has greatly increased over the past few years, it is still orders of magnitude behind the millions (or tens of millions) of developers that mainstream general-purpose languages such as Rust or C++. As the blockchain space continues to grow, there is an increasing need to streamline the process for onboarding millions of new smart contract developers.</p><p>One of the best ways to do this is through integrating the smart contract development process with existing mainstream languages, such as Rust or C++. This is the approach that many non-EVM ecosystems, such as Solana and Cosmos have adopted, with Rust emerging as the de facto smart contract language in those ecosystems. The EVM ecosystem, until now though, primarily relies on its own distinct programming language Solidity to write smart contracts. Arbitrum Stylus, however, seeks to change this through allowing blockchain developers to write smart contracts in mainstream languages such as Rust and then deploy on EVM-compatible chains.</p><h3>Making Smart Contract Execution more Efficient</h3><p>Over the past few years, as decentralized applications have exploded in popularity, there has been a dramatically increased demand for on-chain computation, especially on the Ethereum network. This spike in network demand has led to exorbitant gas prices. This in turn has spurred a flurry of innovation in increasing the transactional throughput of public blockchains, and Arbitrum is one of the most prominent projects and ecosystems in this space. This includes the flagship <a href="https://arbitrum.io/rollup">Arbitrum One</a> L2 chain, as well as the <a href="https://docs.arbitrum.io/inside-arbitrum-nitro/">Arbitrum Nitro</a> tech stack.</p><p>Arbitrum Stylus is a natural extension of all these and the latest solution in Arbitrum&#8217;s toolkit. Compared to previous solutions, which focus on optimizing the inter-transactional efficiency of transactions (such as batching transactions through rollups), Stylus focuses on optimizing the intra-transactional level &#8211; specifically, how each transaction is executed. Through allowing contracts to be executed in WebAssembly (WASM), Stylus contracts are an order of magnitude faster, promising lower gas fees, as well as having access to memory that can be up to 100-500x cheaper than using the EVM [2].</p><h2>Stylus: Providing WASM + EVM Composability</h2><h3>WebAssembly and Arbitrum Nitro</h3><p>To understand why Stylus is so much more efficient and composable than a traditional EVM engine, we need to first understand the role of WebAssembly, or WASM. WASM is a form of assembly language, which means that it is essentially machine-readable binary code, rather than human-readable languages such as Rust or C++. Instead, these human-readable languages need a &#8220;compiler&#8221; to transform them into machine-readable &#8220;assembly languages&#8221; before they are executed.</p><p>WASM in particular, as its name suggests, is an assembly language optimized for web browsers, to increase the executional speed of primarily Javascript-based Web applications. By being a portable, modular and easily executable assembly language, WASM allows developers to directly write code snippets in a variety of mainstream languages, such as Rust or C++ [3].</p><p>With <a href="https://medium.com/offchainlabs/arbitrum-nitro-one-small-step-for-l2-one-giant-leap-for-ethereum-bc9108047450">Arbitrum&#8217;s Nitro</a> upgrade, because all disputes on-chain are played out in WASM, this means that Nitro has a working fraud system for any arbitrary WASM [2]. And because Arbitrum Nitro is able to provide fraud proofs for any WASM code, this means that it can provide fraud proofs for any program that compiles down to WASM.</p><p>Arbitrum Stylus primarily adds a WASM execution engine on top of this existing WASM fraud prover inherited from Arbitrum Nitro, based on one of the leading WASM engines called <a href="https://wasmer.io/">Wasmer</a>, which executes code much faster than Geth executes EVM bytecode [2]. With both an execution engine and a proof engine, this enables smart contracts to be completely written, executed, and proved in WASM. Given that many mainstream languages, such as Rust and C++ are able to compile directly into WASM, this in turn is how Arbitrum Stylus allows blockchain developers to write, deploy, and execute smart contracts in a wide variety of mainstream general-purpose languages.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b3a1af4-9287-450f-bd8e-3bf8ab99a5ba_1600x900.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="819" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b3a1af4-9287-450f-bd8e-3bf8ab99a5ba_1600x900.png" width="1456" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>Comparing the EVM with Stylus EVM+. Image from Source [2].</em></figcaption></figure></div><h3>Coherence in the EVM+ Engine</h3><p>Arbitrum Stylus provides developers with the extra option to write contracts in Rust and other WASM-compatible languages, without having to sacrifice the ability to write and execute smart contracts in Solidity. By having two co-equal executional engines of the EVM and WASM, Stylus also provides developers with the option to write part of their application in Solidity, and another part in Rust.</p><p>This, however, raises a question: how does the Stylus VM manage the coherence between the two different engines? How does it know when to switch between EVM and the WASM VM?</p><p>Firstly, Solidity and other EVM-based contracts are compiled into the same bytecode, then executed as they normally would in a pure EVM engine. WASM-based smart contracts, such as those written in Rust for example, will be annotated by an extra &#8220;header&#8221; at the beginning of the contract. Thus, when these contracts are called, the Stylus VM is able to tell which contracts require the EVM engine, and which contracts require the WASM engine. This design also accounts for a large degree of interoperability, where contracts written in WASM can make calls to contracts written in Solidity, and vice versa. This is also the main way in which Stylus differs from other blockchains that have adopted WASM execution engines: Stylus ensures that WASM contracts are completely composable and interoperable with EVM ones, allowing for backwards compatibility and WASM contracts to tap into EVM liquidity.</p><p>Another perspective to look at Stylus&#8217; dual engine of EVM and WASM is to see the blockchain as a &#8220;world state machine&#8221; that undergoes certain state transactions as defined in the EVM. In Ethereum, the on-chain state is represented through a Trie-structure, or a tree-like data structure used to store and retrieve data efficiently [4]. Both Stylus&#8217; EVM and WASM engines use the same Trie-structure to read and write data to and from the &#8220;world state machine.&#8221; Both engines produce some given state change to update the world state; the only difference is how they compute this state change.</p><h3>Cost Savings of the EVM+ Engine</h3><p>Previously, we&#8217;ve already hinted that using the WASM engine can allow for substantial cost savings due to the increased executional efficiency. We can now examine how this is achieved.

Image from Source [7].</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>We can see here that this is 150x cheaper than the EVM add. Given all these gas savings, Stylus VM has even introduced a new subunit of &#8220;gas,&#8221; called &#8220;ink,&#8221; currently defined by default as 1/10000 of 1 gas, and even configurable by the chain owner [5].&nbsp;</p><p>There is, however, one caveat to all these gas savings, namely, it requires gas to activate the Stylus VM in the first place, currently set to a fixed rate of 114 million gas. In addition, calling a Stylus program itself currently takes about 128-2048 gas [5]. Thus, activating the WASM environment just to optimize for a single ADD operation for two integers may not necessarily make economical sense. However, for smart contracts that are memory-intensive, all these savings will compound, offsetting this &#8220;activation cost.&#8221; For example, a call that allocates 3.8 MB of RAM in the EVM would cost ~32 million gas, whereas in the Stylus WASM VM this would only cost ~64 thousand gas, providing a saving of 500x [6]. A corollary to this is that memory-intensive applications are simply not possible on the vanilla EVM, as one quickly runs up against all sorts of gas limits. However, this becomes completely possible in the Stylus VM, given the orders of magnitude cheaper RAM becomes using a WASM runtime.</p><h2>Unlocking New Use Cases with Stylus</h2><h3>1. Memory-Intensive Applications</h3><p>As discussed above, one of the most exciting parts about Arbitrum Stylus is its enabling of memory-intensive applications on-chain. This unlocks a whole new class of applications, such as generative AI NFTs, high-frequency trading, and on-chain gaming [7]. Indeed, Stylus VM may be a landmark technology that allows for AI, notorious for its high memory demands, to be computationally viable on-chain, and be fully interoperable with EVM contracts.</p><h3>2. Alt-VM Composability with EVM Liquidity</h3><p>Moreover, Stylus&#8217; EVM compatibility and ability to allow WASM-based contracts to be interoperable with native Solidity contracts means that these WASM contracts can fully tap into the massive liquidity and user base on the EVM. Recall that we&#8217;ve mentioned before that many alternative VMs, such as Solana and Cosmos, use WASM-compatible languages such as Rust to execute their smart contracts. Stylus&#8217; WASM engine means that developers in these alternative VMs can easily port their contracts over to the EVM ecosystem and immediately take advantage of the EVM&#8217;s liquidity.</p><h3>3. General-Purpose Libraries, Precompiles, and Debugging Infrastructure</h3><p>Another advantage of Stylus allowing developers to use mainstream languages such as Rust and C++ to write their smart contracts is that developers can make use of the massive amounts of general-purpose libraries that support these mainstream languages that contain everything from on-chain computation to cryptographic primitives to file I/O.</p><p>More importantly, developers can benefit from sophisticated tooling infrastructure built for these mainstream languages. This not only includes advanced package managers, but also familiar debugging infrastructure, such as the GDB toolkit in C/C++. All this will likely greatly increase the development familiarity of web3, and allow for a much simpler onboarding process into blockchain development and the EVM stack.</p><h3>4. Bringing On-Chain Computation to the IoT for DePIN</h3><p>With WASM&#8217;s increased executional efficiency, Stylus VM may open the door to integrate on-chain computation with portable devices in the Internet of Things (IoT) &#8211; including everything from traffic lights to smart fridges to smartwatches. Although WASM was originally intended for browser environments, its portable, modular architecture and efficient execution has made it a perfect fit for IoT devices, which require small and efficient runtimes [8].</p><p>Thus, Arbitrum Stylus&#8217; WASM VM is a natural fit for the growing trend of Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN), which seek to use blockchain networks and novel token incentives to maintain physical infrastructure, from WiFi systems to solar-powered batteries [9]. As much of DePIN relies on integration of the blockchain stack with IoT devices, Arbitrum Stylus could serve as an important gateway to allow for these devices to both efficiently run WASM based computation and tap into EVM-liquidity through the Arbitrum ecosystem [10].</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Throughout this article, we&#8217;ve explored in depth the motivation, implementation, and impact of Arbitrum. Stylus. By enabling developers to write and deploy smart contracts in a wide variety of mainstream languages, Stylus makes blockchain development both more accessible and efficient, combining mainstream composability with EVM liquidity to unlock a wide range of novel applications, especially those that are memory-intensive. Thus, Stylus is arguably a landmark project in defining the next generation of composable smart contracts, becoming a platform that is able to blur the boundaries between web2 and web3 development to create a more efficient, integrated, and performant blockchain development stack.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Thanks for reading the Stanford Blockchain Review!

总结:<br />
非同质化代币(NFTs)的定价模型需要平衡复杂性和可解释性。传统上，GBDT被用于NFT定价，虽准确但不透明。本文提出了一种新的“高级评估模型”，它结合了市场基础结构和基本原则，考虑NFT的细微特征，以提高定价的可导航性。该模型摒弃了GBDT的复杂性，采用线性回归分析，将价格分解为基础价值、特征权重和特质溢价，使得定价更透明，易于理解。未来，该模型有望与NFT定价Oracle、贷款协议和自动市场 maker等进一步融合，推动NFT领域的定价机制创新。 <div>

Take, for instance, the commonly used metric of a &#8220;floor price&#8221; in NFT trading. We see that in many cases, although the floor price reflects a rough starting point and baseline metric, it usually does not accurately mirror an NFT&#8217;s intrinsic value or features [2].</p><p>Historically, many NFT pricing models have relied on Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT), which, while offering reliable predictions, are extremely complex and hard to interpret [1][4]. In this article, we introduce a new &#8220;Premium Appraisal Model&#8221; for NFT pricing, aimed at creating a novel valuation model that takes into account the market&#8217;s foundational structures and first principles. Through capturing these far more nuanced features of NFTs, we hope to allow creators, traders, and collectors in the NFT space to better navigate the complexities of NFT pricing.</p><h2>Baseline: Gradient-Based Decision Tree Models</h2><p>At present, one common model technique for NFT pricing is Gradient Boosted Decision Trees, or GBDT. This ensemble learning method evolves from the foundational principle of decision trees, wherein individual trees discern decisions based on set criteria. However, what sets GBDT apart is its sequential construction of multiple trees. With each new tree built, it aims to rectify the mistakes of the preceding one, incrementally enhancing the accuracy of the ensemble. This systematic, iterative methodology equips GBDT models with the capability to discern and integrate intricate data patterns and subtle nuances.</p><h3>Strengths of GBDT Models</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Robustness</strong>: GBDTs are resilient to outliers in the dataset, making them suitable for diverse data scenarios.</p></li><li><p><strong>Handling Mixed Data</strong>: GBDTs can seamlessly manage datasets that contain a mix of categorical and numerical features.</p></li><li><p><strong>Automatic Feature Selection</strong>: The nature of the model allows it to prioritize and select relevant features, often reducing the need for extensive feature engineering.</p></li><li><p><strong>Reduced Overfitting</strong>: Due to the ensemble nature and the iterative corrections, GBDTs generally exhibit less overfitting compared to individual decision trees.</p></li></ul><h3>Challenges and Limitations of GBDT Models:</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Complexity</strong>: As an ensemble of multiple trees, understanding the inner workings or tracing a specific decision path in GBDT can be intricate.</p></li><li><p><strong>Training Time</strong>: GBDTs, due to their iterative nature, often require more training time than simpler models.</p></li><li><p><strong>Memory Intensive</strong>: Storing multiple decision trees demands significant memory, which can be a limitation in resource-constrained environments.</p></li></ul><h3>Complexity and Lack of Transparency: The Core Issue</h3><p>The most pronounced challenge with GBDTs in the context of our NFT pricing is the lack of transparency. While the model might provide a price or a valuation, it is a &#8220;black-box&#8221; algorithm that cannot simply explain why it arrives at a given price.</p><p>The very strength of GBDTs, their ability to capture minute data patterns across multiple trees, becomes a double-edged sword when we need to justify or explain a pricing decision to stakeholders. This lack of clear interpretability, results in pricing metrics that are hard to fathom to the various stakeholders in the NFT space. Thus, this underscores the importance of offering a pricing model that offers both accuracy and explainability.</p><h2>Overview of the Premium Model for Strategic NFT Pricing</h2><p>As established above, we are introducing a Premium Model for NFT pricing, one which balances accuracy with explainability by aligning prices with foundational principles and traits of these digital assets.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdc2afe86-adb6-4e51-981e-a2644bb6a8ca_1600x495.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="450" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdc2afe86-adb6-4e51-981e-a2644bb6a8ca_1600x495.png" width="1456" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p><em>A NFT pricing consists of collection-based value and its trait premiums</em></p><p>The core formula underpinning the Premium Model is expressed as:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8601d7ee-9dc5-44b7-9aa2-44c118ee7001_1600x262.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="118.83653846153847" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8601d7ee-9dc5-44b7-9aa2-44c118ee7001_1600x262.png" width="727" /><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Here:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Estimate Price</strong>: The predicted value of the NFT.</p></li><li><p><strong>Floor Price</strong>: The lowest price at which an NFT is currently listed for sale in a particular collection or category on the market.</p></li><li><p><strong>Intercept</strong>: This could be considered as a base adjustment to the floor price, accounting for intrinsic factors that might universally adjust prices up or down across a given NFT collection or market.</p></li><li><p><strong>Trait Weights</strong>: These are the coefficients that are assigned to each trait to determine how much that trait influences the price of an NFT.

We can implement the linear regression model using open-source machine learning libraries to build our premium model based on the above analysis [7].</p><h3>Appraisal Demonstration</h3><p>We can use our premium pricing model for the rare Bored Ape Yacht Club<a href="https://nftgo.io/asset/ETH/0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d/7403"> #7403</a>.

This in turns allows for a pragmatic, adaptive, and transparent valuation approach. We can summarize some of the key features and advantages of the Premium Appraisal Model as follows:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Linearity:</strong> The Premium Model preserves a linear relationship with the floor price, maintaining consistent price ratios among NFTs and traits, contingent upon a determined set of weights.</p></li><li><p><strong>Transparency:</strong> A standout feature is the model&#8217;s inherent transparency, as the parameters are not only easy to validate but also offer clear visibility into the valuation process.</p></li><li><p><strong>Real-Time Responsiveness:</strong> The model embodies a real-time nature, where an NFT&#8217;s price is reflexive to alterations in the floor price, ensuring that valuations are consistently in sync with prevailing market dynamics.</p></li><li><p><strong>Credible Neutrality:</strong> Eschewing third-party biases such as rarity perception or sentimental value, the parameters are deduced through a linear average, grounded strictly in transaction history and utilizing only sale price and floor price as inputs during training.</p></li><li><p><strong>Interpretability:</strong></p></li></ul><ol><li><p><em>Clarity in Parameters: </em>Each parameter, whether it&#8217;s weights or intercept, is infused with tangible meaning, elucidating trait importance and collection base value within the NFT space.</p></li><li><p><em>Shared Trait Weights:</em> Analogous to how traits permeate through different NFTs, trait weights are cohesively shared across various NFT prices, ensuring a unified and consistent valuation approach.</p></li></ol><p></p><p>Thus, the Premium Model balances simplicity and complexity to ensure transparency in the ever-changing world of NFTs. By focusing on clarity, adaptability, and fairness, it provides a strong foundation for valuing NFTs accurately and effectively.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Pricing models are crucial in the fast-paced NFT marketplace, where transparency is highly valued. While tree-based models like GBDT have been popular, their complexity can pose challenges. To address this, there's a shift towards more transparent linear premium models.</p><p>Looking ahead, we expect to integrate premium models with NFT Pricing Oracles, Lending Protocols, and Automated Market Makers (AMMs). For instance, in NFT Pricing Oracles like Chainlink, premium models can refine pricing inputs, ensuring more stable pricing feeds. In NFT Lending Protocols such as BendDAO, advanced pricing models can facilitate secure NFT-collateralized loans, opening up new avenues for NFTs in DeFi.</p><p>Additionally, in AMMs for NFTs like Uniswap v4, advanced pricing models could enhance swapping algorithms, aligning rewards with NFT value and rarity. Beyond this, premium models could navigate fractionalized NFT ownership, shape NFT indices, and drive the evolution of synthetic NFTs, all while maintaining robust, transparent, and user-friendly pricing mechanisms across NFT platforms and financial applications.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Thanks for reading the Stanford Blockchain Review!

总结:
本文探讨了如何将传统官僚主义原则融入去中心化自治组织（DAOs）的治理中，以提高其效率和有效性。作者提出，虽然DAOs本质上是去中心化的，但可以从官僚机构的明确层级、分工、规则和程序、基于能力的晋升等方面学习。文章建议实施基于贡献的声誉系统、正式的冲突解决流程以及在保持去中心化的同时适度引入结构，以平衡两者。最后，作者强调了这种融合带来的挑战，包括法律认可、合同执行和纠纷解决，同时指出这可能对未来的组织理论和区块链应用有深远影响。 <div>

As interest and adoption of DAOs grow, these leaderless digital communities need to continuously prove their effectiveness and sustainability.&nbsp;</p><p>While DAOs are decentralized by design, there may be valuable lessons to learn from traditional bureaucratic governance models known for stability, efficiency, and accountability. In this article, we explore a theoretical and conceptual framework for how integrating certain bureaucratic principles into DAO governance could address some of the challenges facing DAOs today.</p><h2>The Anatomy of DAOs</h2><p>DAOs, or Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, allow groups to self-organize and make decisions collectively through smart contracts on the blockchain. DAOs have no central leadership - governance and operations are managed through pre-coded rules enforced on the blockchain.</p><p>In order to facilitate governance operations, DAOs usually issue a token, in which the protocol sells tokens in exchange for governance rights for users. Oftentimes, these tokens are also able to be exchanged on secondary markets and exchanges [1]. The Uniswap protocol, for example, has a UNI token which allows its holders to be able to vote on governance decisions.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd6d8842a-bd8d-4f72-8255-4443814adca3_1386x610.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="610" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd6d8842a-bd8d-4f72-8255-4443814adca3_1386x610.png" width="1386" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>DAO Voting Procedure. Source: <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/learn/types-of-daos">https://cointelegraph.com/learn/types-of-daos</a>&nbsp;</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>Typically, during the governance process, voting delegates will propose ideas on internal governance forums or tools like Snapshot, and will proceed with rounds of temperature checks and requests for comments with other voting members. Once the proposal has been finalized, this will then proceed to an on-chain vote, during which all DAO members holding the governance token are able to express their preferences [2].</p><p>Although there are a large variety of DAOs across the blockchain industry, ranging from protocol DAOs such as MakerDAO, to NFT DAOs such as NounsDAO, to grants DAOs such as GitcoinDAO, there are several questions common across many different decentralized governance protocols [1].</p><p>One of the main responsibilities of DAOs is to ensure collective asset management. As a DAO grows in terms of users and treasury resources, whether that is through token sales, or through successful operation of the underlying protocol, the DAO needs to manage the treasury capital much like a company to be successful in the long run. Furthermore, because usually a DAO&#8217;s assets on its balance sheet are often composed of risky assets such as tokens, NFTs, and other digital assets, a DAO needs to implement risk management operations to ensure that it can stay solvent and operational. A third governance area typically found in DAOs is in asset curation, acting as art and culture curators for its digital assets, such as in the case of PleasrDAO. Essentially, DAO members will vote for whether new items should be added to its collection, or existing assets should be removed [3].</p><p>Despite their growing importance in decision-making in the blockchain space, DAOs today face challenges like decision-making gridlocks, lack of accountability, and difficulties handling conflicts. Thus, exploring how principles of traditional bureaucratic governance can allow us to better understand how to make DAOs more efficient and effective as decentralized governing bodies, both in the blockchain space and beyond.</p><h2>An Overview of Weberian Bureaucracy Theory</h2><p>To understand how to augment DAOs with principles of bureaucracy, we need to first understand the defining characteristics of bureaucracy. In this aspect, German sociologist Max Weber was one of the first to formalize the study of bureaucracy and define its main characteristics [4].</p><p>Within Weber&#8217;s ideal bureaucracy, there are clear hierarchical structures, specialized roles, established procedures, and clear lines of control and command. This allows bureaucracies to carry out complex tasks efficiently.</p><p>Some of the key principles of bureaucratic governance include [5]:</p><ul><li><p>Hierarchy - Clear chains of command with higher levels overseeing and directing lower levels.</p></li><li><p>Division of labor - Activities are divided into specialized, routine tasks assigned to different positions.</p></li><li><p>Formal rules and procedures - Operations follow pre-defined, documented protocols.</p></li><li><p>Merit-based hiring and promotion - Selection and advancement are based on technical qualifications judged through standardized criteria.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Impersonality - Applying rules uniformly without bias or favoritism.</p></li><li><p>Regulatory - All related decisions and the capabilities of authorities are required to comply with regulations.</p></li></ul><p>Today, we see bureaucratic structures prevalent in coordinating organization in large-scale entities, including governments, militaries, and multi-national corporations, through its ability to establish rigorous and orderly systems of operation.&nbsp;</p><p>As DAOs grow in both size and complexity, integrating these principles of bureaucratic governance and organization may allow DAOs to effectively coordinate larger numbers of people and larger amounts of resources. However, bureaucracies also have downsides like rigidity, red tape, and difficulty adapting to change. Thus, we need to carefully consider which elements of bureaucratic operation we are able to integrate into processes of decentralized governance.</p><h2>Blending Bureaucracy into DAOs</h2><p>While integrating bureaucratic principles into decentralized organizations may seem counterintuitive, a closer examination reveals opportunities for targeted adaptation. Through careful implementation, certain bureaucratic elements could enhance DAO governance and operations. While the below principles are not intended to be exhaustive, they may represent a starting point for exploration as to how DAOs can integrate principles of bureaucratic governance to increase operational efficiency [6].</p><h3>Implementing Merit-Based Reputation Systems</h3><p>Bureaucratic organizations often use merit-based systems for advancement. Similarly, DAOs could develop more nuanced reputation systems to reward those who create value.&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, reputation could be earned through long-term participation, technical contributions, or wise governance proposals. Higher reputation could grant increased voting influence. This incentivizes committed members while reducing apathy and plutocratic governance.&nbsp;</p><h3>Formalizing Conflict Resolution Procedures&nbsp;</h3><p>Conflicts frequently paralyze DAOs lacking structured resolution frameworks. Introducing graduated conflict resolution processes could smooth gridlocks.</p><p>DAOs offer a novel approach to accountability, characterized by transparency and an immutable record of actions on the blockchain. Within a conflict resolution procedure, on-chain actions and records may be used as evidence for arbitration.</p><p>Initially disputes could enter structured mediation between conflicting parties. If unresolved, a community vote could follow. For more serious conflicts, cryptographically secured arbitrations could provide final recourse.&nbsp;</p><p>This multi-stage framework would maintain community involvement while introducing procedural formality. It resembles bureaucratic structures balancing hierarchy with shared governance.</p><h3>Balancing Structure and Decentralization</h3><p>Integrating the above elements risks over-bureaucratizing DAO governance. Therefore, decentralization should remain fundamental. Bureaucracy could provide scaffolds to support DAO scaling while avoiding rigid centralization antithetical to DAO principles.</p><p>For example, working groups could form organically based on needs identified by the community instead of being mandated top-down. Merit-based reputation should not fully override the equality of members. Conflict resolution procedures could be ratified and amended by the community.</p><p>By thoughtfully balancing bureaucratic integration with decentralized principles, DAOs can evolve governance that draws on the best of both paradigms. This synthesis promises to unlock greater scalability and versatility for DAOs while retaining their core ethos.</p><h2>Open Questions and Social Implications of DAOs</h2><p>Blending bureaucratic principles with decentralized organizations ventures into unexplored territory. It will require experimentation and will likely produce unexpected challenges.</p><p>Critically, adapting bureaucratic practices cannot override the fundamental decentralization and transparency of DAOs. Imposing rigid, top-down structures antithetical to DAO ethos would be counterproductive. The objective should be judiciously supplementing DAO governance, not displacing it.</p><p>Close examination is needed around legal recognition of integrated DAOs. Regulators may show greater willingness to acknowledge DAOs exhibiting characteristics of mature governance through implementing recognizable forms of bureaucratic governance. But questions around enforcing contracts and resolving disputes will still prove challenging, as issues such as dispute resolution and contract enforcement are still relatively unexplored legal areas.</p><p>More broadly, the integration of bureaucratic principles into DAO governance has several potential philosophical and societal implications. This includes both a theoretical discussion in organizational theory of how organizational forms evolve and adapt to new technological innovations such as the blockchain, as well as practical applications in integrating blockchain applications into existing bureaucratic structures such as public administration and large-scale corporate governance.</p><p>DAOs, with their decentralized nature, pose fundamental questions about how we organize and govern collective activities. By investigating how bureaucratic principles can be applied to DAOs, we might contribute to a wider conversation about the future of governance in a digital, decentralized world.&nbsp;</p><p>The expanding realm of DAOs offers an ideal testing ground for pioneering new organizational systems, which can shed light on how principles of traditional governance can be reimagined in the context of digital communities, virtual worlds, and metaverses. It could provide valuable insights into how we can ensure accountability, equity, and democratic participation in these emerging digital landscapes.</p><p><em><strong>Note:</strong> This work was originally written as a final research proposal for Stanford University&#8217;s <strong><a href="https://cs352b.stanford.edu/">CS 352B: Blockchain Governance</a></strong> class.

<div> 关键词：NFTs、价值、区块链、连续性、研究

总结:
这篇文章讨论了NFTs（非同质化代币）的兴起和早期研究的不足。作者指出，尽管NFTs被批评为投机泡沫，但其核心价值在于它们提供的独特历史和身份连续性。文章提出“连续性理论”作为解释NFT价值的一个角度，强调区块链技术使数字对象有了可追溯的历史，区别于传统数字文件。此外，文章还提出了五个开放的研究方向，包括NFT的技术特性、跨链NFT、NFT收藏、数字产权和NFT在元宇宙中的角色。总的来说，NFT现象揭示了我们对数字所有权和价值的新认识，需要进一步深入研究以理解其经济、心理和社会影响。 <div>

One problem was that few of us had done any actual research. It&#8217;s also fair to say that we were much too proud about knowing what &#8220;fungible&#8221; meant.&nbsp;</p><p>As a result we blew some important opportunities to communicate the phenomenon. In March of 2021, when NFTs were just starting to get covered by media outlets, I was profiled by Vox but mostly rambled about &#8220;<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/social-meaning-and-linguistic-variation/biographical-indexicality-personal-history-as-a-frame-of-reference-for-social-meaning-in-variation/2DF6DD721632DC378E327F88D82C1B4F">biographical indexicality</a>&#8221;. Then the next month The Atlantic ran a long article titled &#8220;<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/nfts-show-value-owning-unownable/618525/">What Critics don&#8217;t understand about NFTs</a>&#8221;, which seemed to promise a sympathetic explanation, and from two Harvard academics no less! [1][2]</p><p>But the article was sadly incurious, and just painted NFTs as an incomprehensible &#8220;craze&#8221;, and one that was interesting only insofar as it reminds us of the fact that people often buy things &#8220;not because of any innate worth&#8221; to them, but simply because they &#8220;expect others to value it later.&#8221; This perspective on NFTs, along with the <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/energy-consumption/">fortunately now-moot</a> arguments about climate impact, became the dominant and essentially sole NFT critique up to the present day [3].</p><p>There was something strange about these criticisms. Certainly they were right to call out the obvious NFT speculation that was and is going on. I said the same thing myself when I was interviewed. But critics often seemed to want to insist that, not only was there an NFT bubble, but that NFTs themselves were completely valueless. This is a strange claim. It would be like reading an article on the Housing bubble that also wanted to insist that nobody liked houses. Or a history book covering the Tulip craze that also kept arguing that tulips are all ugly.&nbsp;</p><p>Which is all to say that these articles were making one correct and commendable point &#8211; that NFTs had formed a speculative bubble &#8211; but tacking on another extraordinary point that this bubble had formed around absolutely nothing. That nobody could possibly like any of these things.</p><h2>The Dominant Narrative and the Missing Link</h2><p>The dominant media narrative split people&#8217;s opinion and understanding of NFTs. From outside crypto people were led to imagine that NFTs were entirely a grift, and perhaps the most cynical of grifts since supposedly nobody believed in or liked them.&nbsp;</p><p>Not everyone outside of crypto was so dismissive though. Ezra Klein gave a lucid and strong case for them as an interview prompt: &#8220;the ability to have verifiable, digitally scarce goods&#8230; is simply a functionality the internet needs. We have it in the physical world and it&#8217;s come into the internet&#8221;, and the great Stephen Wolfram liked NFTs and wanted to launch a collection. But the overall drum beat of &#8220;NFTs are a scam&#8221; grew and grew. [4][5]</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F72cdc713-0e6f-454d-a28f-88a242f8d7c3_1600x591.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="538" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F72cdc713-0e6f-454d-a28f-88a242f8d7c3_1600x591.png" width="1456" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>Searches for &#8220;NFT + Scam&#8221; over time. Retrieved September 8, 2023.</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>And even within crypto the loudest voices often seemed confused, at least at first. One reason for this is that NFTs had been a genuinely grassroots phenomenon. They were then, and they are to this day, the only major application on Ethereum that <a href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1477402803433840642?s=20">was not predicted in the original Ethereum Whitepaper.</a> Though NFTs were not completely new in 2021, they had been popular only within a small but serious community of artists, creators, and enthusiasts [6].</p><p>These OG NFT enthusiasts were not particularly prominent as thought leaders, and so most of the traditional crypto thought leaders were starting from scratch. The unfortunate result of this info-vacuum was an influx of interest in &#8220;Utility NFTs&#8221;, as if crypto-permissioning was best done by gas-inefficient tokens that featured irrelevant aesthetic metadata. Gating access with a utility NFT is like making your movie ticket a t-shirt or a poster. It might make sense (and has been done!), but only if people like t-shirts or posters, otherwise you&#8217;re just wasting your money creating an expensive ticket where a paper one (or an ERC-20 one) will do [7].</p><p>Furthermore, early opinions often talked around the fundamental question of whether people liked the NFTs themselves. Instead, NFTs were &#8220;a receipt&#8221;, &#8220;an autograph&#8221;, a token granting some special &#8220;access to the artist&#8221;, etc. Whatever the story, it seemed the NFT&#8217;s value was always elsewhere, in some intellectual property, some other valuable thing that was being autographed, recorded, or accessed by the NFT.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed36cc6e-f115-449f-b3e2-1f44476d35a5_1190x398.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="398" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed36cc6e-f115-449f-b3e2-1f44476d35a5_1190x398.png" width="1190" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Whatever we think of these theories now, it appears that nobody bothered to actually research them. Were people collecting free floating artist signatures? Were they really buying an artist&#8217;s attention in a weird way? Were they really buying and selling receipts? All would honestly be pretty interesting.</p><p>These theories certainly did not make NFTs seem more understandable or appealing to outsiders (&#8220;come pay to talk to artists you&#8217;ve never heard of!&#8221;). And compounding the matter further was the fact that even prominent thinkers who did understand NFTs were not always crystal clear in their writing about them. For instance, a 2022 paper from Glen Weyl, Puja Ohlhaver and Vitalik Buterin noted that &#8220;blockchains offer traceability in transactions that prevents someone from right-click copy-and-pasting a valuable NFT (and sybil attacking the original owner)&#8221;. This is completely correct, but it would also be extremely confusing to an outsider&#8211;the technology does not &#8220;prevent&#8221; anyone from copy and pasting the image of course. Only when &#8220;the NFT&#8221; is understood to mean something like &#8220;a digital object uniquely tied to some set of events&#8221; does their point make sense [8].</p><p>By 2022 it might have seemed obvious that NFTs were being differentiated and valued based on their unique histories (rather than, say, their aesthetic qualities), and so Buterin et al. offered no citation for their claim. But suppose they had wanted to &#8211; what could they even cite? No research had been done.&nbsp;</p><h2>A Personal Journey into NFT Research</h2><p>My research into NFTs is mostly a bit of history &#8211; I was intrigued by NFTs during my PhD but, as an economist (even a behavioral one) it seemed pretty far afield. As far as I can tell, the phenomenon of valuing an object based on its unique history is completely commonplace in the real world and yet completely novel in the digital world until NFTs. That is, someone might proudly display in their house the real home run ball that Barry Bonds hit, but nobody seemed to ever ask which mp3 file is the &#8220;real one.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>This phenomenon is novel and important in the history of digital life. Just as privacy is something taken for granted in the real world&#8211;the ability to close a door and be truly alone for a bit&#8211;so too is uniqueness. And if privacy is fairly scarce in our digital lives, uniqueness was almost completely unheard of.&nbsp;</p><p>So as a side project, I looked into markets for goods which seemed to resemble NFTs. Art markets are weird and contrarian, so I settled on the more home-spun memorabilia market. The interesting example I found was James Naismith&#8217;s typewritten <em>Rules of Basketball, </em>which were auctioned off by Sotheby&#8217;s for $4.4m. Naismith&#8217;s two typed pages are now proudly displayed at Kansas University.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbda9eca1-fc76-417e-91e1-d96187fc3fa8_393x700.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="700" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbda9eca1-fc76-417e-91e1-d96187fc3fa8_393x700.png" width="393" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>The Naismith example was so interesting to me since, being typewritten, the documents are not aesthetically unique. That is, if a bidder truly just wanted that text on paper from an 1890s typewriter, they could have saved millions by just buying Naismith&#8217;s model of typewriter for a few hundred dollars. A sort of retro &#8220;right click, save as&#8221;.</p><p>Sotheby&#8217;s promotional materials for the Naismith auction emphasized that the document was &#8220;typed up the very morning that Naismith introduced his new sport to the world&#8221;. This suggests that the appeal lies in some notion of continuity. And this continuity angle is an argument for why a blockchain specifically would be important for NFTs. That is, we couldn&#8217;t ask which mp3 was the &#8220;real one&#8221; because mp3 files didn&#8217;t have a continuous history in any relevant sense. We could now ask which art was the &#8220;real&#8221; art, because the blockchain could make sense of such an idea [9].</p><h2>The Continuity Theory of NFTs</h2><p>The Ship of Theseus Paradox is a famous example of our conflicting intuitions about identity. Theseus&#8217; ship has been restored by replacing every single wooden part and then, in Thomas Hobbes&#8217; version, the discarded pieces of the &#8220;true&#8221; ship are reassembled into another identical ship. The former ship, with replaced parts, is continuous with Theseus&#8217; original ship, but the latter, with original parts, is now identically composed to the original. This paradox reveals a tension in our intuitions about which of two objects is the &#8220;real&#8221; one, here teasing apart continuity vs. composition.</p><p>Note, however, that the composition argument relies on continuity as well. In Hobbes&#8217; version of the Theseus paradox, someone &#8220;had kept the Old Planks as they were taken out, and by putting them afterward together in the same order, had again made a Ship of them&#8221;. That is, the &#8220;re-composed&#8221; Theseus&#8217; Ship has planks that have a continuous identity over time tracing back to the original Ship. If it didn&#8217;t, and the planks were new, we&#8217;d just call the ship a replica.[10] {1}.</p><p>Continuity thus seems to be a core feature of identity and, indeed, research on infant cognition by Elizabeth Spelke suggests that continuity is the &#8220;central&#8217;&#8217; concept of identity. It requires an object to trace &#8220;exactly one connected path over space and time&#8221;. This is, of course, what the ERC-721 standard provides and is thus suggestive of why unique digital objects emerged with NFTs. [10]</p><p>A study of digital cognition could, for instance, repurpose some of Spelke&#8217;s experiments in a digital context to see if this notion of continuity makes a difference in people&#8217;s perception of digital objects, as in the outlined experiment in the figure below.<br /></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F15f236ec-c905-41c3-86d7-e64b3ec41f6e_1100x850.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="850" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F15f236ec-c905-41c3-86d7-e64b3ec41f6e_1100x850.png" width="1100" /><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p><em>An experimental design contrasting (1) The UTXO model of identity, (2) The ERC-721 model, (3) The non-blockchain OSI model, the sidechain (NFT) model. In each panel, an object A that begins in period 1 on the left progresses through some change in period 2. Then in period 3 (on the right of each panel) we ask whether we can tell which object is A.</em></p><p>The continuity theory of NFTs received some supportive evidence with the rise of Ordinals/Inscriptions on the Bitcoin Blockchain. The Bitcoin UTXO model, as in the above figure in quadrant (1), does not enable continuous identity natively because transfers split the &#8220;object&#8221; without distinguishing between its parts. But Ordinals proposed a &#8220;first in, first out&#8221; interpretation of UTXO transactions which provided, at least at some level, continuity. With Ordinals, and a notion of continuity, people began to value Bitcoin-native NFTs {2}.</p><h2>Open Research Directions and Questions</h2><p>But that is only one theory, and it&#8217;s surely an incomplete one. So I will close this essay offering some other potentially fruitful avenues of research.&nbsp;</p><h3>1. What technical aspects of NFTs serve to differentiate them, and how/why?&nbsp;</h3><p>This research could be market-driven, evaluating whether for instance &#8220;on-chain NFTs&#8221;, which are reproducible entirely from the contracts and tokens themselves, matter to demand? Or what about NFTs which have their referenced media stored on IPFS or otherwise hashed in the metadata?&nbsp;</p><p>This research could also be experimental or psychological, abstracting these technical qualities into whatever assurances or signals they provide. Ideally, a theory of a &#8220;minimally viable NFT&#8221; could be developed, identifying the essential qualities an NFT should possess.</p><h3>2. How &#8220;chain specific&#8221; are NFTs? Are bridged NFTs like Emblem Vault, treated as &#8220;real&#8221;? Why?</h3><p>Bridged NFTs, which are NFTs which originate on one-chain but are owned, bought, and sold on another, represent a fascinating test case. Though Ethereum-native NFTs dominate the market, applications like Emblem Vault have &#8220;bridged&#8221; over valuable, often historical, NFTs from other blockchains. Emblem Vault alone has seen nearly $100 million dollars in transactions of these bridged assets.</p><p>Is it the blockchain architecture that creates this interoperability? Or, equivalent, could we predict what assets could not be bridged? Is there something quality enhancing about a bridged NFT? E.g. Is the NFT perceived to be more real, or more long lasting on a larger (or more decentralized) blockchain?</p><h3>3. What is the nature of an &#8220;NFT collection&#8221;</h3><p>A notable feature of the NFT world is that many are sold as parts of &#8220;collections&#8221; of aesthetically and/or conceptually similar items. One reason for this appears to be tradition, as the first prominent Profile Picture (&#8220;PFP&#8221;) collection, CryptoPunks, was an edition of 10,000. However, the market into which 10,000 CryptoPunks were sold was tiny compared with the market into which, say, the 10,000 Azuki PFPs were sold some 4 years later. Is tradition really so strong? Or is there something else important about this number?&nbsp;</p><p>One possibility is that in some contexts NFTs create a &#8220;minimal group&#8221; which enables greater cooperation. Owners of a Bored Ape would, in this analogy, be like the experimental participants who expressed a preference for Klee over Kandinsky in the classic experiments. What are the analogues for this sort of behavior in art, fashion, or other markets? [11]&nbsp;</p><h3>4. NFTs and digital property rights</h3><p>In property rights theory, ownership is the possession of some set of rights over a resource, most particularly (1) the right to exclude others from the resource ("exclusivity") and (2) the right to sell or transfer ownership of the resource ("alienability".) These rights may be enforced by a third party, such as legal enforcement by police officers acting as agents of a court, but they may also emerge as a result of non-legal cooperative action. [12]</p><p>NFTs are a striking example of non-legal cooperative enforcement via blockchains, with a clear provision of exclusivity and alienability. This makes them a natural fit for the study of non-legal property rights. There is a further overlap in more recent theories of property and the public domain. To take an example from Stephenson 2022, adapting an argument from Yoram Barzel,&nbsp; &#8220;suppose that you own a sandwich and I take a bite without permission. In that case I have violated your property rights. But if I look at the sandwich, or even photograph the sandwich and hang the photo on my wall, I likely have not violated your property rights. Thus the visual attributes of a displayed sandwich are in the public domain. In a similar way to the sandwich owner, NFT owners seem content to openly display the aesthetic qualities of their NFT, allowing anyone to view them, download them, etc. for free.&#8221;&nbsp; We might then ask what would constitute a &#8220;bite of the sandwich&#8221; for an NFT? [13]</p><p>These features of blockchain-based NFTs make them especially suitable for study in Property Rights Theory. Not only are they novel examples of effective non-government property enforcement at scale, they are also spartan about what lies in the private domain: essentially just an NFT&#8217;s tokenid and contract address pair are excludable and alienable.</p><h3>5. NFTs, Metaverse, and Display</h3><p>Metaverse pioneers proposed a vast VR world in which we could all play and build.&nbsp; It was originally imagined as a shared substrate owned by a single organization&#8211;the &#8220;Association for Computing Machinery&#8221;-- and the political economy of such a scenario is more than a little concerning. I&#8217;ve argued elsewhere that NFTs, as shared virtual objects, are essentially the metaverse arriving backwards; &#8220;object first&#8221; rather than substrate first.[14]&nbsp;</p><p>Existing NFTs largely colonize fragments of &#8220;metaverse&#8221; space we&#8217;re offered on the modern internet, such as the PFP spaces most social media allows. But what other spaces exist? And do these determine the way NFTs are used, consumed and valued?</p><p>Further, there is interest in exhibiting NFTs on digital displays like the Samsung Frame. What are the emerging norms around such a display&#8211;is there an expectation that display signals ownership? That is, would displaying an NFT that you don&#8217;t own be more comparable to displaying an art print (not deceptive) or wearing a counterfeit jacket from a popular brand (deceptive, at least in some contexts.)</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Researchers have fertile ground ahead in investigating the technical, psychological, and sociological aspects of NFTs. The economic relationship to evolving notions of digital property rights, their role in the broader metaverse, and their implications on digital display and authenticity are all further topics ripe for exploration. Each of these areas not only promises insights into the mechanics and nuances of NFTs but also offers reflections on our evolving digital culture and the intertwining of technology with societal values.&nbsp;</p><p>The advent of NFTs has revealed a chasm in our collective understanding of digital ownership and value. The discourse has often been polarized, oscillating between the extremes of dismissiveness and unbridled enthusiasm. In such times we need research that can help unpack and explain the NFT phenomenon for what it really is. NFTs are surely less than what their most enthusiastic proponents suggest, but likely more, much more, than the critics suppose.&nbsp;</p><h1>About the Author</h1><p><em><a href="https://twitter.com/stephensonhmatt">Dr. Matt Stephenson</a> is the Head of Cryptoeconomics at Pantera Capital.
