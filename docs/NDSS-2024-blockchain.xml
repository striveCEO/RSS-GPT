<content:encoded><![CDATA[

The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is currently the largest decentralized storage solution in operation, with thousands of active participants and millions of daily content transfers. IPFS is used as remote data storage for numerous blockchain-based smart contracts, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT), and decentralized applications. We present a content censorship attack that can be executed with minimal effort and cost, and that prevents the retrieval of any chosen content in the IPFS network. The attack exploits a conceptual issue in a core component of IPFS, the Kademlia Distributed Hash Table (DHT), which is used to resolve content IDs to peer addresses. We provide efficient detection and mitigation mechanisms for this vulnerability. Our mechanisms achieve a 99.6% detection rate and mitigate 100% of the detected attacks with minimal signaling and computational overhead. We followed responsible disclosure procedures, and our countermeasures are scheduled for deployment in the future versions of IPFS.

<title>Front-running Attack in Sharded Blockchains and Fair Cross-shard Consensus</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Sharding is a prominent technique for scaling blockchains. By dividing the network into smaller components known as shards, a sharded blockchain can process transactions in parallel without introducing inconsistencies through the coordination of intra-shard and cross-shard consensus protocols. However, we observe a critical security issue with sharded systems: transaction ordering manipulations can occur when coordinating intra-shard and cross-shard consensus protocols, leaving the system vulnerable to attack. Specifically, we identify a novel security issue known as finalization fairness, which can be exploited through a front-running attack. This attack allows an attacker to manipulate the execution order of transactions, even if the victim's transaction has already been processed and added to the blockchain by a fair intra-shard consensus. To address the issue, we offer Haechi, a novel cross-shard protocol that is immune to front-running attacks. Haechi introduces an ordering phase between transaction processing and execution, ensuring that the execution order of transactions is the same as the processing order and achieving finalization fairness. To accommodate different consensus speeds among shards, Haechi incorporates a finalization fairness algorithm to achieve a globally fair order with minimal performance loss. By providing a global order, Haechi ensures strong consistency among shards, enabling better parallelism in handling conflicting transactions across shards. These features make Haechi a promising solution for supporting popular smart contracts in the real world. To evaluate Haechi's performance and effectiveness in preventing the attack, we implemented the protocol using Tendermint and conducted extensive experiments on a geo-distributed AWS environment. Our results demonstrate that Haechi can effectively prevent the presented front-running attack with little performance sacrifice compared to existing cross-shard consensus protocols.

<title>Pisces: Private and Compliable Cryptocurrency Exchange</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Cryptocurrency exchange platforms such as Coinbase, enable users to purchase and sell cryptocurrencies conveniently just like trading stocks/commodities. However, because of the nature of blockchain, when a user withdraws coins (i.e., transfers coins to an external on-chain account), all future transactions can be learned by the platform. This is in sharp contrast to conventional stock exchange where all external activities of users are always hidden from the platform. Since the platform knows highly sensitive user private information such as passport number, bank information etc, linking all (on-chain) transactions raises a serious privacy concern about the potential disastrous data breach in those cryptocurrency exchange platforms. In this paper, we propose a cryptocurrency exchange that restores user anonymity for the first time. To our surprise, the seemingly well-studied privacy/anonymity problem has several new challenges in this setting. Since the public blockchain and internal transaction activities naturally provide many non-trivial leakages to the platform, internal privacy is not only useful in the usual sense but also becomes necessary for regaining the basic anonymity of user transactions. We also ensure that the user cannot double spend, and the user has to properly report accumulated profit for tax purposes, even in the private setting. We give a careful modeling and efficient construction of the system that achieves constant computation and communication overhead (with only simple cryptographic tools and rigorous security analysis); we also implement our system and evaluate its practical performance.

<title>A Two-Layer Blockchain Sharding Protocol Leveraging Safety and Liveness for Enhanced Performance</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Sharding is a critical technique that enhances the scalability of blockchain technology. However, existing protocols often assume adversarial nodes in a general term without considering the different types of attacks, which limits transaction throughput at runtime because attacks on liveness could be mitigated. There have been attempts to increase transaction throughput by separately handling the attacks; however, they have security vulnerabilities. This paper introduces Reticulum, a novel sharding protocol that overcomes these limitations and achieves enhanced scalability in a blockchain network without security vulnerabilities. Reticulum employs a two-phase design that dynamically adjusts transaction throughput based on runtime adversarial attacks on either or both liveness and safety. It consists of 'control' and 'process' shards in two layers corresponding to the two phases. Process shards are subsets of control shards, with each process shard expected to contain at least one honest node with high confidence. Conversely, control shards are expected to have a majority of honest nodes with high confidence. Reticulum leverages unanimous voting in the first phase to involve fewer nodes in accepting/rejecting a block, allowing more parallel process shards. The control shard finalizes the decision made in the first phase and serves as a lifeline to resolve disputes when they surface. Experiments demonstrate that the unique design of Reticulum empowers high transaction throughput and robustness in the face of different types of attacks in the network, making it superior to existing sharding protocols for blockchain networks.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Smart contracts play a vital role in the Ethereum ecosystem. Due to the prevalence of kinds of security issues in smart contracts, the smart contract verification is urgently needed, which is the process of matching a smart contract’s source code to its on-chain bytecode for gaining mutual trust between smart contract developers and users. Although smart contract verification services are embedded in both popular Ethereum browsers (e.g., Etherscan and Blockscout) and official platforms (i.e., Sourcify), and gain great popularity in the ecosystem, their security and trustworthiness remain unclear. To fill the void, we present the first comprehensive security analysis of smart contract verification services in the wild. By diving into the detailed workflow of existing verifiers, we have summarized the key security properties that should be met, and observed eight types of vulnerabilities that can break the verification. Further, we propose a series of detection and exploitation methods to reveal the presence of vulnerabilities in the most popular services, and uncover 19 exploitable vulnerabilities in total. All the studied smart contract verification services can be abused to help spread malicious smart contracts, and we have already observed the presence of using this kind of tricks for scamming by attackers. It is hence urgent for our community to take actions to detect and mitigate security issues related to smart contract verification, a key component of the Ethereum smart contract ecosystem.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

ROS2 is a popular publish/subscribe based middleware that allows developers to build and deploy a wide-variety of distributed robotics applications. Unfortunately, ROS2 offers applications poor control over how their data is consumed by downstream applications. We present Picaros, a decentralized information-flow control (DIFC) system tailored for ROS2. The decentralized and distributed architecture of ROS2 poses new challenges to building a DIFC system that prior work has not addressed. Picaros adopts a novel approach to address these challenges by casting and solving the problem of DIFC within the framework of attribute-based encryption (ABE). Picaros's design embraces the unique nature of the ROS2 platform and carefully avoids any centralized elements. This paper presents the design and implementation of Picaros and reports on our experiments that use Picaros's ABE-based approach for DIFC with ROS2 applications.

As Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) continue to grow in popularity, NFT users have become targets of phishing scammers, called NFT drainers. Over the last year, $100 million worth of NFTs were stolen by drainers, and their presence remains a serious threat to the NFT trading space. However, no work has yet comprehensively investigated the behaviors of drainers in the NFT ecosystem. In this paper, we present the first study on the trading behavior of NFT drainers and introduce the first dedicated NFT drainer detection system. We collect 127M NFT transaction data from the Ethereum blockchain and 1,135 drainer accounts from five sources for the year 2022. We find that drainers exhibit significantly different transactional and social contexts from those of regular users. With these insights, we design DRAINCLoG, an automatic drainer detection system utilizing Graph Neural Networks. This system effectively captures the multifaceted web of interactions within the NFT space through two distinct graphs: the NFT-User graph for transaction contexts and the User graph for social contexts. Evaluations using real-world NFT transaction data underscore the robustness and precision of our model. Additionally, we analyze the security of DRAINCLoG under a wide variety of evasion attacks.

<title>dRR: A Decentralized, Scalable, and Auditable Architecture for RPKI Repository</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Although Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) is critical for securing inter-domain routing, we find that its key component, the RPKI Repository, is under studied. We conduct the first data-driven analysis of the existing RPKI Repository infrastructure, including a survey of worldwide AS administrators and a large-scale measurement of the existing RPKI Repository. Based on the findings of this study, we identify three key problems. Firstly, misbehaving RPKI authorities can easily manipulate RPKI objects, and Internet Number Resources (INRs) holders and Relying Parties (RPs) can neither prevent malicious behaviors of misbehaving authorities nor hold them accountable. Secondly, RPKI Repository is sensitive to failures: An attack or downtime of any Publication Point (PP) will prevent RPs from obtaining complete RPKI object views. Finally, we identify scalability issues with the current RPKI Repository, which are expected to worsen with the further deployment of Route Origin Authorization (ROA). To address these problems, we propose dRR, an architecture that enhances the security, robustness, and scalability of the RPKI Repository while being compatible with standard RPKI. By introducing two new entities: Certificate Servers (CSs) and Monitors, dRR forms a decentralized federation of CSs, which enables the RPKI Repository to proactively defend against malicious behavior from authorities and to tolerate PPs' failures. dRR is also scalable for future large-scale deployment. We present the design of dRR in detail and implement a prototype of dRR on a global Internet testbed spanning 15 countries. Experimental results show that, although new security features are introduced, dRR only incurs negligible latency for certificate issuance and revocation. The throughput of certificate updates achieved by dRR is 450 times higher than the current maximum RPKI certificate update frequency.

<title>From Interaction to Independence: zkSNARKs for Transparent and Non-Interactive Remote Attestation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Remote attestation (RA) protocols have been widely used to evaluate the integrity of software on remote devices. Currently, the state-of-the-art RA protocols lack a crucial feature: transparency. This means that the details of the final attestation verification are not openly accessible or verifiable by the public. Furthermore, the interactivity of these protocols often limits attestation to trusted parties who possess privileged access to confidential device data, such as pre-shared keys and initial measurements. These constraints impede the widespread adoption of these protocols in various applications. In this paper, we introduce zRA, a non-interactive, transparent, and publicly provable RA protocol based on zkSNARKs. zRA enables verification of device attestations without the need for pre-shared keys or access to confidential data, ensuring a trustless and open attestation process. This eliminates the reliance on online services or secure storage on the verifier side. Moreover, zRA does not impose any additional security assumptions beyond the fundamental cryptographic schemes and the essential trust anchor components on the prover side (i.e., ROM and MPU). The zero-knowledge attestation proofs generated by devices have constant size regardless of the network complexity and number of attestations. Moreover, these proofs do not reveal sensitive information regarding internal states of the device, allowing verification by anyone in a public and auditable manner. We conduct an extensive security analysis and demonstrate scalability of zRA compared to prior work. Our analysis suggests that zRA excels especially in peer-to-peer and Pub/Sub network structures. To validate the practicality, we implement an open-source prototype of zRA using the Circom language. We show that zRA can be securely deployed on public permissionless blockchains, serving as an archival platform for attestation data to achieve resilience against DoS attacks.

<title>Like, Comment, Get Scammed: Characterizing Comment Scams on Media Platforms</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Given the meteoric rise of large media platforms (such as YouTube) on the web, it is no surprise that attackers seek to abuse them in order to easily reach hundreds of millions of users. Among other social-engineering attacks perpetrated on these platforms, comment scams have increased in popularity despite the presence of mechanisms that purportedly give content creators control over their channel comments. In a comment scam, attackers set up script-controlled accounts that automatically post or reply to comments on media platforms, enticing users to contact them. Through the promise of free prizes and investment opportunities, attackers aim to steal financial assets from the end users who contact them. In this paper, we present the first systematic, large-scale study of comment scams. We design and implement an infrastructure to collect a dataset of 8.8 million comments from 20 different YouTube channels over a 6-month period. We develop filters based on textual, graphical, and temporal features of comments and identify 206K scam comments from 10K unique accounts. Using this dataset, we present our analysis of scam campaigns, comment dynamics, and evasion techniques used by scammers. Lastly, through an IRB-approved study, we interact with 50 scammers to gain insights into their social-engineering tactics and payment preferences. Using transaction records on public blockchains, we perform a quantitative analysis of the financial assets stolen by scammers, finding that just the scammers that were part of our user study have stolen funds equivalent to millions of dollars. Our study demonstrates that existing scam-detection mechanisms are insufficient for curbing abuse, pointing to the need for better comment-moderation tools as well as other changes that would make it difficult for attackers to obtain tens of thousands of accounts on these large platforms.

<title>Not your Type! Detecting Storage Collision Vulnerabilities in Ethereum Smart Contracts</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

In recent years, the Ethereum blockchain has seen significant growth and adoption. One of the key factors of its success is the possibility to run immutable programs known as smart contracts. Smart contracts allow for the automatic manipulation of digital assets and play a central role in the new decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. With the growth of DeFi, the interactions between smart contracts have become increasingly complex, enabling advanced financial protocols and applications. However, bugs in smart contract interactions are also a common cause of critical vulnerabilities that result in considerable financial losses. In this paper, we study and detect a type of cross-contract vulnerability known as a storage collision. A smart contract uses storage to persistently store its data on the blockchain. Typically, each contract has its own separate storage. However, it is also possible that two smart contracts share their storage (using a delegate call). Unfortunately, when these two contracts have different understandings of the types/semantics of their shared storage, a storage collision vulnerability can occur. This may lead to unexpected behavior such as denial of service (frozen funds), privilege escalation, and theft of financial assets. To detect and investigate the impact of storage collision vulnerabilities at scale, we propose CRUSH, a novel analysis system that discovers these flaws and synthesizes proof-of-concept exploits. We leverage CRUSH to perform a large-scale analysis of 14,237,696 smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain since its genesis. CRUSH identifies 14,891 potentially vulnerable contracts and automatically synthesizes an end-to-end exploit for 956 of them. Our system uncovers more than $6 million of novel, previously unreported potential financial damage caused by storage collision vulnerabilities.

<title>Proof of Backhaul: Trustfree Measurement of Broadband Bandwidth</title>

<guid>https://papers.cool/venue/proof-of-backhaul-trustfree-measurement-of-broadband-bandwidth@NDSS</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Recent years have seen the emergence of decentralized wireless networks consisting of nodes hosted by many individuals and small enterprises, reawakening the decades-old dream of open networking. These networks have been deployed in an organic, distributed manner and are driven by new economic models resting on performance-based incentives. A critical requirement for the incentives to scale is the ability to prove network performance in a decentralized ``trustfree" manner, i.e., a Byzantine fault tolerant network telemetry system. In this paper, we present a Proof of Backhaul (PoB) protocol which measures the bandwidth of the (broadband) backhaul link of a wireless access point, termed prover, in a decentralized and trustfree manner. In particular, our proposed protocol is the first to satisfy the following two properties: (1) Trustfree. Bandwidth measurement is secure against Byzantine attacks by collusion of challenge servers and the prover. (2) Open. The barrier-to-entry for being a challenge server is low; there is no requirement of having a low latency and high throughput path to the measured link. At a high-level, our protocol aggregates the challenge traffic from multiple challenge servers and uses cryptographic primitives to ensure that a subset of challengers or, even challengers and provers, cannot maliciously modify results in their favor. A formal security model allows us to establish guarantees of accurate bandwidth measurement as a function of the maximum fraction of malicious actors. We implement our protocol with challengers spread across geographical locations and release the code~cite{multichallenger-pob}. Our evaluation shows that our PoB protocol can verify backhaul bandwidth of up to 1000 Mbps with less than 10% error using measurements lasting only 100 ms. The measurement accuracy is not affected in the presence of corrupted challengers. Importantly, the basic verification protocol lends itself to a minor modification that can measure available bandwidth even in the presence of cross-traffic. Finally, the security guarantees of our PoB protocol output are naturally composable with ``commitments" on blockchain ledgers, which are commonly used for decentralized networks.

<title>Secure Multiparty Computation of Threshold Signatures Made More Efficient</title>
<link>https://papers.cool/venue/secure-multiparty-computation-of-threshold-signatures-made-more-efficient@NDSS</link>
<guid>https://papers.cool/venue/secure-multiparty-computation-of-threshold-signatures-made-more-efficient@NDSS</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Threshold signatures, notably ECDSA, are fundamental for securing decentralized applications. Their non-linear structure poses challenges in distributed signing, often tackled by pairwise multiplicative-to-additive share conversion, leading to O(n) communication and O(n2) verification costs for each of n signers. Moreover, most schemes lack robustness, necessitating a complete restart upon fault. A pioneering work by Wong et al. (NDSS '23) still requires rolling back to the preceding round to resume signing after another round to convince all other signers. We revisit secure multiparty computation from threshold linearly homomorphic encryption (LHE). Realizing its public verifiability and fault recovery, we encompass two technical contributions to Castagnos–Laguillaumie LHE (CT-RSA '15): a 2-round robust distributed key generation (DKG) protocol in the dishonest majority setting and an accompanying zero-knowledge proof allowing extraction in an unknown-order group. We extend the DKG with dual-code-based verification (ACNS '17), upgrading its O(tn2)-cost private verifiability to an O(n2) public one. Built on our DKG, we present the first threshold ECDSA protocol with O(1) communication and O(n) verification per-party costs while matching the lowest round complexity of nonrobust schemes (CCS '20). Empirically, we halve the computation and communication costs of the signing phase compared to state-of-the-art robust threshold ECDSA (NDSS '23). We also illustrate the versatility of our techniques with an improved threshold extension (IEEE S&P '23) of BBS+ signatures (IEEE Syst. J. '13).

<title>Security-Performance Tradeoff in DAG-based Proof-of-Work Blockchain Protocols</title>
<link>https://papers.cool/venue/security-performance-tradeoff-in-dag-based-proof-of-work-blockchain-protocols@NDSS</link>
<guid>https://papers.cool/venue/security-performance-tradeoff-in-dag-based-proof-of-work-blockchain-protocols@NDSS</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain protocols based on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) have demonstrated superior transaction confirmation performance compared to their chain-based predecessors. However, it is uncertain whether their security deteriorates in high-throughput settings similar to their predecessors, because their acceptance of simultaneous blocks and complex block dependencies presents challenges for rigorous security analysis. We address these challenges by analyzing DAG-based protocols via a congestible blockchain model (CBM), a general model that allows case-by-case upper bounds on the block propagation delay, rather than a uniform upper bound as in most previous analyses. CBM allows us to capture two key phenomena of high-throughput settings: (1) simultaneous blocks increase each other's propagation delay, and (2) a block can be processed only after receiving all the blocks it refers to. We further devise a reasonable adversarial block propagation strategy in CBM, called the late-predecessor attack, which exploits block dependencies to delay the processing of honest blocks. We then evaluate the security and performance of Prism and OHIE, two DAG-based protocols that aim to break the security-performance tradeoff, in the presence of an attacker capable of launching the late predecessor attack. Our results show that these protocols suffer from reduced security and extended latency in high-throughput settings similar to their chain-based predecessors.

<title>Separation is Good: A Faster Order-Fairness Byzantine Consensus</title>
<link>https://papers.cool/venue/separation-is-good-a-faster-order-fairness-byzantine-consensus@NDSS</link>
<guid>https://papers.cool/venue/separation-is-good-a-faster-order-fairness-byzantine-consensus@NDSS</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Order-fairness has been introduced recently as a new property for Byzantine Fault-Tolerant (BFT) consensus protocol to prevent unilaterally deciding the final order of transactions, which allows mitigating the threat of adversarial transaction order manipulation attacks (e.g., front-running) in blockchain networks and decentralized finance (DeFi). However, existing leader-based order-fairness protocols (which do not rely on synchronized clocks) still suffer from poor performance since they strongly couple fair ordering with consensus processes. In this paper, we propose SpeedyFair, a high-performance order-fairness consensus protocol, which is motivated by our insight that the ordering of transactions does not rely on the execution results of transactions in previous proposals (after consensus). SpeedyFair achieves its efficiency through a decoupled design that performs fair ordering individually and consecutively, separating from consensus. In addition, by decoupling fair ordering from consensus, SpeedyFair enables parallelizing the order/verify mode that was originally executed serially in the consensus process, which further speeds up the performance. We implement a prototype of SpeedyFair on the top of the Hotstuff protocol. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that SpeedyFair significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art order-fairness protocol (i.e., Themis), which achieves a throughput of 1.5×-2.45× greater than Themis while reducing latency by 35%-59%.
