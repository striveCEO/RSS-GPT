<div> 关键词：subliminal channel, blockchain, secret-recoverable splittable signature, public-key, random oracle model

总结:<br />
本文提出了一种利用区块链上秘密可恢复分割签名方案的公开密钥隐秘通信渠道。这种设计在随机Oracle模型下，在常见加密假设下是不可检测的。方法适用于98种顶级加密货币中使用的98种秘密可恢复分割签名方案，仅增加每条消息一个签名的常量开销。研究还分析了比特币、Monero和RippleNet网络的适用性，并提供了比特币和RippleNet的原型实现。这一创新为匿名但可追踪的通信提供了一种新的可能，增加了信息安全的隐蔽性。 <div>
Messengers have become an essential means of interpersonal interaction. Yet untraceable private communication remains an elusive goal, as most messengers hide content, but not communication patterns. The knowledge of communication patterns can by itself reveal too much, as happened, e.g., in the context of the Arab Spring. Subliminal channels in cryptographic systems enable untraceable private communication in plain sight. In this context, bulletin boards in the form of blockchains are a natural object for subliminal communication: accessing them is innocuous, as they rely on distributed access for verification and extension. At the same time, blockchain users generate hundreds of thousands of transactions per day that are individually signed and placed on the blockchain. Thus, blockchains may serve as innocuous repository for publicly accessible cryptographic transactions where subliminal channels can be placed. This significantly increases the availability of publicly accessible cryptographic transactions where subliminal channels can be placed.
In this paper, we propose a public-key subliminal channel using secret-recoverable splittable signature schemes on blockchains and prove that our construction is undetectable in the random oracle model under common cryptographic assumptions. Our approach is applicable to any secret-recoverable splittable signature scheme and introduces a constant overhead of a single signature per message. Such schemes are used by 98 of the top 100 cryptocurrencies. We also analyze the applicability of our approach to the Bitcoin, Monero, and RippleNet networks and present proof of concept implementations for Bitcoin and RippleNet.

<div> 关键词：remote attestation (RA), transparency, zkSNARKs, non-interactive, publicly provable

总结:
本文介绍了一种新型的远程验证协议(zRA)，它利用零知识 Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (zkSNARKs)技术，解决了现有RA协议的透明度问题。zRA无需预共享密钥或访问敏感数据，实现了无交互、公开可验证的设备验证。它不依赖在线服务，也不增加额外的安全假设，适用于点对点和发布/订阅网络结构。作者还开发了开源实现，并表明zRA适用于公共许可区块链，用于存储和保护免受DoS攻击的认证数据。总的来说，zRA促进了更广泛地采用远程验证技术，保证了系统的可信度和审计性。 <div>
Remote attestation (RA) protocols have been widely
used to evaluate the integrity of software on remote devices.
Currently, the state-of-the-art RA protocols lack a crucial feature: transparency. This means that the details of the final
attestation verification are not openly accessible or verifiable by
the public. Furthermore, the interactivity of these protocols often
limits attestation to trusted parties who possess privileged access
to confidential device data, such as pre-shared keys and initial
measurements. These constraints impede the widespread adoption
of these protocols in various applications.
In this paper, we introduce zRA, a non-interactive, transparent, and publicly provable RA protocol based on zkSNARKs.
zRA enables verification of device attestations without the need
for pre-shared keys or access to confidential data, ensuring a
trustless and open attestation process. This eliminates the reliance
on online services or secure storage on the verifier side. Moreover,
zRA does not impose any additional security assumptions beyond
the fundamental cryptographic schemes and the essential trust
anchor components on the prover side (i.e., ROM and MPU).
The zero-knowledge attestation proofs generated by devices have
constant size regardless of the network complexity and number
of attestations. Moreover, these proofs do not reveal sensitive
information regarding internal states of the device, allowing verification by anyone in a public and auditable manner. We conduct
an extensive security analysis and demonstrate scalability of zRA
compared to prior work. Our analysis suggests that zRA excels
especially in peer-to-peer and Pub/Sub network structures. To
validate the practicality, we implement an open-source prototype
of zRA using the Circom language. We show that zRA can be
securely deployed on public permissionless blockchains, serving
as an archival platform for attestation data to achieve resilience
against DoS attacks.

<div> 关键词：secure merge, uniformly random lists, near linear, logarithmic overheads, implementation

总结:<br />
本文主要探讨了在处理随机列表的 secure merge 问题上，提出了一种新的协议。该协议实现了近乎线性的通信和计算复杂度，每轮运行时间为 $O(\log\log n)$，对于长度为 $2^{20}$ 的列表，运行时间和通信量比现有状态提高了一个数量级。与之前的理论工作相比，虽然在理论上的最优时间复杂度有所差距，但实证表明，新协议在实际应用中更为高效。此外，该协议还扩展到了来自任意分布的列表，尤其是当列表近似同分布时，效率接近于随机列表，从而显著提升了 PSI 和 Secure Join 等关键应用的性能。 <div>
Secure merge refers to the problem of merging two sorted lists. The problem appears in different settings where each list is held by one of two parties, or the lists are themselves shared among two or more parties. The output of a secure merge protocol is secret shared. Each variant of the problem offers many useful applications.

The difficulty in designing secure merge protocols vis-a-vis insecure merge protocols (which work in linear time with a single pass over the lists) has to do with operations having to be oblivious or data-independent. In particular, the protocol cannot leak the positions of items of each list in the final merged list. On account of this, sorting-based secure merge protocols have been a common solution to the problem. However, as they introduce (poly)logarithmic overheads, there has been active investigation into the task of building (near) linear time secure merge protocols. Most recently, Hemenway et al. put forth a protocol for secure merge that does achieve linear communication and computation and a round complexity of $O({\log\log n})$, where $n$ is the length of the lists being merged. While this shows the feasibility of a linear time secure merge, it still leaves room for the design of a concretely efficient linear time secure merge.

In this work, we consider a relaxation of the problem where the lists are uniformly random. We show a secure merge protocol for uniformly random lists that achieves $O({n\log\log n})$, i.e., near linear communication and computation and a round complexity of $O({\log\log n})$, where $n$ is the length of the lists being merged. Our protocol design is general and can be instantiated in a variety of settings so long as the building blocks (basic ones such as comparisons and shuffles) can be realized in said settings. Although we do not achieve the same asymptotic guarantees as Hemenway et al., our work is concretely efficient. We implement our protocol and compare it to the state of the art sorting protocols and demonstrate an order of magnitude improvement in running times and communication for lists of size of $2^{20}$. 

We also extend our protocol to work for lists sampled from arbitrary distributions. In particular, when the lists are (close to) identically distributed, we achieve the same efficiency as uniform lists. This immediately improve the performance of many crucial applications including PSI & Secure Join, thus illustrating the significance and applicability of our protocol in practice.

<div> 关键词：Decentralized Finance（去中心化金融）、Automated Market Makers（自动市场 maker，AMM）、Blockchain、Scalability（可扩展性）、ammBoost。

总结: <br />
文章讨论了去中心化金融（DeFi）中自动市场 makers（AMM）的可扩展性问题，尤其是在区块链上处理大量交易时产生的存储和交易成本问题。为解决这一问题，作者提出了一种名为ammBoost的新型侧链架构，旨在减少链上交易、提高吞吐量并支持区块链修剪。该系统采用多种技术确保AMM的正确性和安全性。通过构建Uniswap启发式用例的原型，实验结果表明ammBoost能将交易气体成本降低94.53%，链增长至少减少80%，并且能够支持比实际Uniswap高出500倍的日流量。总的来说，ammBoost是一种有效的解决方案，旨在优化AMM在DeFi中的性能和可持续性。 <div>
Automated market makers (AMMs) are a form of decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges and considered a prime example of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications. Their popularity and high trading activity have resulted in millions of on-chain transactions leading to serious scalability issues. In this paper, we address the on-chain storage overhead problem of AMMs by utilizing a new sidechain architecture as a layer 2 solution, building a system called ammBoost. Our system reduces the amount of on-chain transactions, boosts throughput, and supports blockchain pruning. We devise several techniques to enable layer 2 processing for AMMs while preserving correctness and security of the underlying AMM. We also build a proof-of-concept of ammBoost for a Uniswap-inspired use case to empirically evaluate its performance. Our experiments show that ammBoost decreases the gas cost by 94.53% and the chain growth by at least 80%, and that it can support up to 500x of the daily traffic volume observed for Uniswap in practice.

<title>A Two-Layer Blockchain Sharding Protocol Leveraging Safety and Liveness for Enhanced Performance</title>

<div> 关键词：Reticulum, sharding, blockchain, scalability, adversarial nodes

总结: <br />
Reticulum是一种创新的分片协议，旨在解决区块链网络中的可扩展性和安全性问题。它采用两阶段设计，分为控制和处理分片，以应对不同类型的攻击。控制分片确保网络的多数诚实节点，而处理分片负责交易处理，通过一致同意减少参与验证的节点，实现高吞吐量。在出现争议时，控制分片作为仲裁者。实验表明，Reticulum在保持高交易速度的同时，具有更强的抗攻击性，相较于现有协议更具优势。 <div>
Sharding is a critical technique that enhances the scalability of blockchain technology. However, existing protocols often assume adversarial nodes in a general term without considering the different types of attacks, which limits transaction throughput at runtime because attacks on liveness could be mitigated. There have been attempts to increase transaction throughput by separately handling the attacks; however, they have security vulnerabilities. This paper introduces Reticulum, a novel sharding protocol that overcomes these limitations and achieves enhanced scalability in a blockchain network without security vulnerabilities.

Reticulum employs a two-phase design that dynamically adjusts transaction throughput based on runtime adversarial attacks on either or both liveness and safety. It consists of `control' and `process' shards in two layers corresponding to the two phases. Process shards are subsets of control shards, with each process shard expected to contain at least one honest node with high confidence. Conversely, control shards are expected to have a majority of honest nodes with high confidence. Reticulum leverages unanimous voting in the first phase to involve fewer nodes in accepting/rejecting a block, allowing more parallel process shards. The control shard finalizes the decision made in the first phase and serves as a lifeline to resolve disputes when they surface.

Experiments demonstrate that the unique design of Reticulum empowers high transaction throughput and robustness in the face of different types of attacks in the network, making it superior to existing sharding protocols for blockchain networks.

<div> 关键词：non-interactive verifiable secret sharing (NI-VSS), class groups (cgVSS), range proof, public verifiability, non-interactive distributed key generation (NI-DKG).

总结:
本文提出了一种基于类群的非交互式可验证秘密共享方案(cgVSS)，它不依赖于范围证明，利用类群的独特结构实现高效的大整数加密。cgVSS简化了NI-VSS过程，相比现有方案有显著性能提升。文章还定义了公共可验证性，并扩展到即使所有接收者可能被攻击也能保持的强公共可验证性。通过通用转换，作者得到了一个基于类群的非交互式分布式密钥生成方案(cgDKG)，适用于阈值系统。安全分析考虑了公共可验证性对DKG的影响。总的来说，这篇论文展示了类群在构建高效、可验证的密码学协议中的潜力。 <div>
We put forward a non-interactive verifiable secret sharing (NI-VSS) scheme using class groups – we call it cgVSS. Our construction follows the standard framework of encrypting the shares to a set of recipients and generating a non-interactive proof of correct sharing. However, as opposed to prior works, such as Groth’s [Eprint 2021], or Gentry et al.’s [Eurocrypt 2022], we do not require any range proof - this is possible due to the unique structure of class groups, that enables efficient encryption/decryption of large field elements in the exponent of an ElGamal-style encryption scheme. Importantly, this is possible without destroying the additive holomorphic structure, which is required to make the proof-of-correctness highly efficient. This approach not only substantially simplifies the NI-VSS process, but also outperforms the state-of-art schemes significantly. For example, our implementation shows that for a 150 node system cgVSS outperforms (a simplified implementation of) Groth’s protocol in overall communication complexity by 5.6x, about 9.3 − 9.7x in the dealer time and 2.4 − 2.7x in the receiver time per node.

Additionally, we formalize the notion of public verifiability, which enables anyone, possibly outside the participants, to verify the correctness of the dealing. In fact, we re-interpret the notion of public verifiability and extend it to the setting when potentially all recipients may be corrupt and yet can not defy public verifiability – to distinguish from state-of-art, we call this strong public verifiability. Our formalization uses the universal composability framework.

Finally, through a generic transformation, we obtain a non-interactive distributed key generation (NI-DKG) scheme for threshold systems, where the secret key is the discrete log of the public key. Our security analysis in the VSS-hybrid model uses a formalization that considers a (strong) public verifiability notion for DKG, even when more than threshold parties are corrupt. Instantiating with cgVSS we obtain a NI-DKG scheme from class groups – we call it cgDKG.

<div> 关键词：Byzantine共识、异步协议、可信设置、公钥加密、随机 oracle。

总结:<br />
本文研究了无需可信设置和不使用公钥加密的异步拜占庭共识协议。提出了一种基于随机 oracle 的 Asynchronous Common Subset（ACS）协议，具有$O(\kappa n^3)$总通信量和$O(1)$期望轮数。该协议仅依赖于密码哈希函数，因此对量子攻击也安全。与现有实现相比，实验表明该协议更为高效。此外，文中还介绍了新引入的异步秘密密钥共享和覆盖聚集等概念，这些可能独立具有价值。 <div>
Byzantine consensus is a fundamental building block in distributed cryptographic problems. Despite decades of research, most existing asynchronous consensus protocols require a strong trusted setup and expensive public-key cryptography. In this paper, we study asynchronous Byzantine consensus protocols that do not rely on a trusted setup and do not use public-key cryptography such as digital signatures. We give an Asynchronous Common Subset (ACS) protocol whose security is only based on cryptographic hash functions modeled as a random oracle. Our protocol has $O(\kappa n^3)$ total communication and runs in expected $O(1)$ rounds. The fact that we use only cryptographic hash functions also means that our protocol is post-quantum secure. The minimal use of cryptography and the small number of rounds make our protocol practical. We implement our protocol and evaluate it in a geo-distributed setting with up to 128  machines. Our experimental evaluation shows that our protocol is more efficient than the only other setup-free consensus protocol that has been implemented to date. En route to our asynchronous consensus protocols, we also introduce new primitives called asynchronous secret key sharing and cover gather, which may be of independent interest.

<div> 关键词：generative AI, zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP), folding-based zkSNARKs, VIMz, trustless smart contract system

总结:
本文探讨了随着生成式AI技术的发展，媒体真实性验证的需求增加。为确保图像来源的可信度，作者提出了一种名为VIMz的高效可验证图像操纵系统，它利用折叠式zkSNARKs技术降低证明者复杂性。与先前方法相比，VIMz在处理高清和4K图像时，实现了时间速度提升3倍，内存消耗减少96倍（从309GB降至3.2GB）。此外，文章还设计了一个无信任智能合约系统，用于自动验证媒体真实性的证明，支持版权和所有权的透明管理，符合内容可追溯性和真实性联盟（C2PA）标准。这一系统为构建去中心化的媒体市场奠定了基础，具有广泛的应用前景。 <div>
With the rise of generative AI technology, the media's credibility as a source of truth has been significantly compromised. This highlights the need to verify the authenticity of media and its originality.
Ensuring the integrity of media during capture using the device itself presents a straightforward solution to this challenge.
However, raw captured media often require certain refinements or redactions before publication. Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) offer a solution by allowing attestation of the correctness of specific transformations applied to an authorized image. While shown to be feasible, previous approaches faced challenges in practice due to their high prover complexity.

In this paper, we aim to develop a practical framework for efficiently proving the authenticity of HD and 4K images on commodity hardware. Our goal is to minimize prover complexity by utilizing the folding-based zkSNARKs technique, resulting in VIMz, the first practical verifiable image manipulation system of this kind. VIMz leverages Nova's folding scheme to achieve low complexity recursive zkSNARK proofs of authentic image manipulation. Our implementation results demonstrate a substantial reduction in prover complexity—up to a 3$\times$ speedup in time and a 96$\times$ reduction in memory (from 309 GB in [Kang et al., arXiv 2022] to only 3.2 GB). Moreover, the low memory consumption allows VIMz to prove the correctness of multiple chained transformations simultaneously, further increasing the performance (up to 3.5$\times$).
Additionally,
we propose a trustless smart contract system that autonomously verifies the proofs of media authenticity, achieving trustless copyright and ownership management, aligning with the standards of the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA).
Such a system serves as a foundational infrastructure for constructing trustless media marketplaces with diverse applications.

<div> 关键词：Function Secret Sharing (FSS), Distributed Point Function (DPF), Comparison Function, Interval Function, Key Size.

总结:<br />
本文主要探讨了一种针对点、比较和区间函数的变体Function Secret Sharing (FSS)方案，旨在实现更紧凑的$p$- party（$p \geq 3$）密钥大小。相比于现有构造，该方案显著减少了DPF的密钥大小，降低了$2^p$倍，同时对非线性解码器进行了一次额外的比较操作。对于分布式比较函数，作者实现了史上最小的密钥大小，减少了一个$q^{p-1}$因子，对隐私保护机器学习（PPML）中的应用有实际意义。此外，文章还展示了如何将这种改进应用于神经网络的分布式实现，如分布式ReLU激活函数，证实了新方案的有效性。 <div>
We present a variant of Function Secret Sharing (FSS) schemes tailored for point, comparison, and interval functions, featuring compact key sizes at the expense of additional comparison. While existing FSS constructions are primarily geared towards $2$-party scenarios, exceptions such as the work by Boyle et al. (Eurocrypt 2015) and Riposte (S&amp;P 2015) have introduced FSS schemes for $p$-party scenarios ($p \geq 3$). This paper aims to achieve the most compact $p$-party FSS key size to date. We achieve a noteworthy reduction in key size, a $2^p$-factor decrease compared to state-of-the-art FSS constructions (including computationally efficient constructions using symmetric-key primitives) of distributed point function (DPF). Compared to the previous public-key-based FSS design for DPF, we also get a key size reduction equal to a $2^{n/2}$-sized row vector, where $2^n$ is the domain size of the point function. This reduction in key size comes at the cost of a required comparison operation by the decoder (hence called a non-linear decoder), a departure from prior schemes. In $p$-party scenarios, our construction outperforms existing FSS constructions in key size, remaining on par with Riposte in evaluation time and showing significant improvement over Boyle et al.

In addition to constructing FSS for distributed point functions (DPF), we extend our approach to distributed comparison and interval functions, achieving the most efficient key size to date. Our distributed comparison function exhibits a key-size reduction by a factor of $q^{p-1}$, where $q$ denotes the size of the algebraic group used in the scheme's construction.
The reduced key size of the comparison function has practical implications, particularly in applications like privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML), where thousands of comparison functions are employed in each neural network layer.
To demonstrate the effectiveness of our improvements, we design and prototype-implement a scalable privacy-preserving framework for neural networks over distributed models. Specifically, we implement a distributed rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function using our distributed comparison function, showcasing the efficacy of our proposed scheme.

<div> 关键词：分布式服务、多党计算（MPC）、身份-based加密、公开可验证、在线扑克。

总结: <br />
我们的文章介绍了一种分布式服务，用于为在线扑克玩家生成私密但可公开验证的关联随机性，如洗牌。该服务利用多党计算协议在离线阶段创建一个加密的卡片排列，确保其是卡片的唯一排列。当玩家加入时，他们仅需通过安全渠道获取身份特定的解密密钥并本地解密，简化了在线过程。文章的关键创新在于提出可缩简证明的多身份基加密（SVME），以及一种高效的小集合随机排列的秘密共享生成协议。整个系统在保证实时性和成本效益的同时，提供了信任最小化的在线扑克体验。在实验中，8个MPC参与者为64张牌生成可验证排列仅需3秒，而玩家获取牌只需0.3秒。 <div>
We develop a distributed service for generating correlated randomness (e.g. permutations) for multiple parties, where each party’s output is private but publicly verifiable. This service provides users with a low-cost way to play online poker in real-time, without a trusted party.
Our service is backed by a committee of compute providers, who run a multi-party computation (MPC) protocol to produce an (identity-based) encrypted permutation of a deck of cards, in an offline phase well ahead of when the players’ identities are known. When the players join, what we call the online phase, they decrypt their designated cards immediately after deriving the identity-based decryption keys, a much simpler computation. In addition, the MPC protocol also generates a publicly-verifiable proof that the output is a permutation.
In our construction, we introduce a new notion of succinctly verifiable multi-identity based encryption (SVME), which extends the existing notion of verifiable encryption to a multi-identity-based setting, but with a constant sized proof – this may be of independent interest. We instantiate this for a permutation relation (defined over a small set) along with identity-based encryption, polynomial commitments and succinct proofs – our choices are made to enable a distributed computation when the card deck is always secret shared. Moreover, we design a new protocol to efficiently generate a secret-sharing of random permutation of a small set, which is run prior to distributed SVME.
Running these protocols offline simplifies the online phase substantially, as parties only derive their identity-specific keys privately via secure channels with the MPC committee, and then decrypt locally to obtain their decks. We provide a rigorous UC-based formalization in a highly modularized fashion.
Finally, we demonstrate practicality with an implementation that shows that for 8 MPC parties, gen- erating a secret publicly-verifiable permutation of 64 cards takes under 3 seconds, while accessing cards for a player takes under 0.3 seconds.

<div> 关键词：Collaborative Graph Learning, Federated Learning, Secure Machine Learning, Graph Neural Networks, CoGNN.

总结:<br />
本文提出了一种新的框架CoGNN，它结合了联邦学习和安全机器学习在协作图学习中的优点。CoGNN通过一种新的消息传递机制和两阶段Dispatch-Collect执行方案，实现了对图神经网络（GNN）训练和推理的隐私保护、高效计算和可扩展性。实验表明，相比于最先进的安全机器学习方法，CoGNN在运行时间和通信成本上分别减少了123倍和522倍，同时保持了与全局图训练相近的模型精度，甚至在某些情况下提高了11.06%。总的来说，CoGNN为协作图学习提供了一个高效且安全的解决方案。 <div>
Collaborative graph learning represents a learning paradigm where multiple parties jointly train a graph neural network (GNN) using their own proprietary graph data. To honor the data privacy of all parties, existing solutions for collaborative graph learning are either based on federated learning (FL) or secure machine learning (SML). Although promising in terms of efficiency and scalability due to their distributed training scheme, FL-based approaches fall short in providing provable security guarantees and achieving good model performance. Conversely, SML-based solutions, while offering provable privacy guarantees, are hindered by their high computational and communication overhead, as well as poor scalability as more parties participate.

To address the above problem, we propose CoGNN, a novel framework that simultaneously reaps the benefits of both FL-based and SML-based approaches. At a high level, CoGNN is enabled by (i) a novel message passing mechanism that can obliviously and efficiently express the vertex data propagation/aggregation required in GNN training and inference and (ii) a two-stage Dispatch-Collect execution scheme to securely decompose and distribute the GNN computation workload for concurrent and scalable executions. We further instantiate the CoGNN framework, together with customized optimizations, to train Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) models. Extensive evaluations on three graph datasets demonstrate that compared with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) SML-based approach, CoGNN reduces up to $123$x running time and up to $522$x communication cost per party. Meanwhile, the GCN models trained using CoGNN have nearly identical accuracies as the plaintext global-graph training, yielding up to $11.06\%$ accuracy improvement over the GCN models trained via federated learning.

总结:
本文主要探讨了适应性签名(Adaptor Signatures, AS)及其增强的安全特性——隐藏见证。AS最初允许签名者为硬关系实例生成预签名，但早期构造存在缺陷，预签名关联的见证会暴露。为解决这个问题，作者提出了一种新的定义，即“见证隐藏”，并证明在仅依赖单向函数假设下，可以构建AS，满足这一安全属性。文章还提出了一种基于签名和弱型陷阱门承诺（特定可适应消息的陷阱门承诺）的通用构造，通过实例化基于汉密尔顿回路问题，扩展到任何NP关系。这一工作为AS的应用，特别是在区块链等场景，提供了更安全的解决方案。 <div>
An adaptor signatures (AS) scheme is an extension of digital signatures that allows the signer to generate a pre-signature for an instance of a hard relation. This pre-signature can later be adapted to a full signature with a corresponding witness. Meanwhile, the signer can extract a witness from both the pre-signature and the signature. AS have recently garnered more attention due to its scalability and interoperability. Dai et al. [INDOCRYPT 2022] proved that AS can be constructed for any NP relation using a generic construction. However, their construction has a shortcoming: the associated witness is exposed by the adapted signature. This flaw poses limits the applications of AS, even in its motivating setting, i.e., blockchain, where the adapted signature is typically uploaded to the blockchain and is public to everyone.

To address this issue, in this work we augment the security definition of AS by a natural property which we call witness hiding. We then prove the existence of AS for any NP relation, assuming the existence of one-way functions. Concretely, we propose a generic construction of witness-hiding AS from signatures and a weak variant of trapdoor commitments, which we term trapdoor commitments with a specific adaptable message. We instantiate the latter based on the Hamiltonian cycle problem. Since the Hamiltonian cycle problem is NP-complete, we can obtain witness hiding adaptor signatures for any NP relation.

<div> 关键词：sequential functions, one-way functions, oracle separation, continuous iterative sequential functions (CISF), fine-grained cryptography

总结:<br />
这篇文章主要探讨了序列函数（sequential functions）的理论复杂性和其与单向函数的关系。作者展示了存在一个黑盒Oracle，它能证明序列函数的存在但不能证明单向函数的存在，这与通常的构造方式形成对比。文章还深入研究了连续迭代序列函数（CISF）的决策性最坏情况问题，证明其是PSPACE-完全的。此外，通过仅假设非单向CISF，构建了“细粒度”加密和MAC等安全协议。最后，文中定义了称为交换式序列函数的新概念，它可用于实现细粒度密钥交换。这些结果揭示了序列函数在密码学中的潜在应用，即使在不依赖单向函数的情况下。 <div>
A sequential function is, informally speaking, a function $f$ for which a massively parallel adversary cannot compute "substantially" faster than an honest user with limited parallel computation power. Sequential functions form the backbone of many primitives that are extensively used in blockchains such as verifiable delay functions (VDFs) and time-lock puzzles. Despite this widespread practical use, there has been little work studying the complexity or theory of sequential functions.

Our main result is a black-box oracle separation between sequential functions and one-way functions: in particular, we show the existence of an oracle $\mathcal{O}$ that implies a sequential function but not a one-way function. This seems surprising since sequential functions are typically constructed from very strong assumptions that imply one-way functions and also since time-lock puzzles are known to imply one-way functions (Bitansky et al., ITCS '16).

We continue our exploration of the theory of sequential functions. We show that, informally speaking, the decisional, worst-case variant of a certain class of sequential function called a continuous iterative sequential function (CISF) is PSPACE-complete. A CISF is, in a nutshell, a sequential function $f$ that can be written in the form $f \left(k, x \right) = g^{k} \left(x \right)$ for some function $g$ where $k$ is an input determining the number of "rounds" the function is evaluated. We then show that more general forms of sequential functions are not contained in PSPACE relative to a random oracle.

Given these results, we then ask if it is possible to build any interesting cryptographic primitives from sequential functions that are not one-way. It turns out that even if we assume just the existence of a CISF that is not one-way, we can build certain "fine-grained" cryptographic primitives where security is defined similarly to traditional primitives with the exception that it is only guaranteed for some (generally polynomial) amount of time. In particular, we show how to build "fine-grained" symmetric key encryption and "fine-grained" MACs from a CISF. We also show how to build fine-grained public-key encryption from a VDF with a few extra natural properties and indistinguishability obfucsation (iO) for null circuits. We do not assume one-way functions. Finally, we define a primitive that we call a commutative sequential function - essentially a sequential function that can be computed in sequence to get the same output in two different ways - and show that it implies fine-grained key exchange.

<div> 关键词：threshold secret sharing, reconstruction time, ramp secret sharing, adaptive corruptions, distributed generation

总结:<br />
该论文研究了改进的阈值秘密共享方案，特别关注减少消息重建时间。提出了一种新型的$(t,c)$-ramp秘密分享方案，对于高阈值$t$（如$2^{20}$），其重建时间比现有方法快2-7.8倍，从$t=256$开始就有明显改善。新方案基于Cramer等人的框架和Applebaum等人的工作，利用随机带状矩阵构建高效且适应适应性攻击的错误纠正代码。应用上，该技术可降低联邦学习中安全聚合协议的计算成本，同时提供更快的可验证ramp秘密共享和分布式可验证随机函数。总的来说，这项工作显著提升了阈值秘密共享的效率和实用性。 <div>
Threshold secret sharing enables distributing a message to $n$ parties such that no subset of fewer than $t$ parties can learn the message, whereas any subset of at least $t$ parties can recover the message. Despite being a fundamental primitive, secret sharing still suffers from one significant drawback, where its message reconstruction algorithm is computationally expensive for large privacy thresholds $t$. In this paper, we aim to address this significant drawback.

We study general $(t,c)$-ramp secret sharing schemes where the number of parties c needed to reconstruct the secret may be larger than $t$. We present a ramp secret sharing scheme whose reconstruction time is 2-7.8x faster than prior constructions suitable against adversaries that adaptively corrupt parties. For $t = 2^{20}$, our new protocol has reconstruction time of 5 seconds whereas prior work requires nearly half a minute. We see improvements starting from as small as $t = 256$. Furthermore, we obtain correctness threshold as small as $c \ge 1.05t$. To obtain our construction, we first improve the secret sharing frameworks by Cramer et al. (EUROCRYPT'15) and Applebaum et al. (CRYPTO'23) from erasure codes. Our new framework obtains secret sharing schemes that may be used against adversaries with adaptive corruptions while requiring only weaker correctness guarantees from the underlying erasure code with a distributed generation property. Furthermore, our new framework also maintains the linear homomorphism of the prior works. Afterwards, we present a concretely efficient erasure code from random band matrices that satisfies the distributed generation property.

We show that our secret sharing scheme can improve many real-world applications. In secure aggregation protocols for federated learning, we obtain up to 22% reductions in computational cost by replacing Shamir's scheme with our construction. We extend our protocol to obtain a verifiable ramp secret sharing scheme where each party can verify the consistency of the shares. Our new verifiable ramp secret sharing has 8.2-25.2x faster sharing and 2.7-23.2x faster reconstruction time compared to prior works. Finally, we present an improved distributed verifiable random function that may be used for decentralized randomness beacons.

<title>Byzantine Fault Tolerance with Non-Determinism, Revisited</title>

<div> 关键词：Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT), non-determinism, Block-ND, multivalued Byzantine agreement (MBA), asynchronous setting

总结:
这篇文章主要关注在非确定性环境下改进拜占庭容错（BFT）算法。作者提出了一种新的设计Block-ND，它将交易顺序的共识和状态共识分离，允许在现有的BFT实现基础上进行扩展。Block-ND通过将状态共识降级为多值拜占庭协议（MBA）来处理非确定性，尽管MBA在实践系统中被忽视。文章提供了一个比现有方案更快的MBA构造，并在部分同步和纯异步环境中实现了Block-ND。实验结果显示，Block-ND在91个节点的广域网部署中，其性能损失相对较小，与传统BFT相比具有更好的适应性。 <div>
The conventional Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) paradigm requires replicated state machines to execute deterministic operations only. In practice, numerous applications and scenarios, especially in the era of blockchains, contain various sources of non-determinism. Despite decades of research on BFT, we still lack an efficient and easy-to-deploy solution for BFT with non-determinism—BFT-ND, especially in the asynchronous setting.
We revisit the problem of BFT-ND and provide a formal and asynchronous treatment of BFT-ND. In particular, we design and implement Block-ND that insightfully separates the task of agreeing on the order of transactions from the task of agreement on the state: Block-ND allows reusing existing BFT implementations; on top of BFT, we reduce the agreement on the state to multivalued Byzantine agreement (MBA), a somewhat neglected primitive by practical systems. Block-ND is completely asynchronous as long as the underlying BFT is asynchronous.
We provide a new MBA construction significantly faster than existing MBA constructions. We instantiate Block-ND in both the partially synchronous setting (with PBFT, OSDI 1999) and the purely asynchronous setting (with PACE, CCS 2022). Via a 91-instance WAN deployment on Amazon EC2, we show that Block-ND has only marginal performance degradation compared to conventional BFT.

<title>Attribute-Based Threshold Issuance Anonymous Counting Tokens and Its Application to Sybil-Resistant Self-Sovereign Identity</title>

<div> 关键词：self-sovereign identity (SSI), CanDID, privacy-preserving, attribute-based threshold anonymous counting tokens (tACT), Sybil-resistant

总结:<br />
本文探讨了自我主权身份（SSI）系统中的挑战，特别是CanDID方案的局限性。作者提出了可公开验证的属性基阈值匿名计数令牌（tACT），这是一种分布式信任环境下的创新解决方案，旨在增强匿名性和减少用户与发行者交互。tACT通过支持阈值发行、多显示选择性披露和非交互式非转移凭证，构建了一个高效的Sybil攻击抵抗的SSI系统。这个新系统在效率上优于CanDID，支持更多发行者，并实现了一轮并行协议，显著提升了用户隐私和控制性。 <div>
Self-sovereign identity (SSI) systems empower users to (anonymously) establish and verify their identity when accessing both digital and real-world resources, emerging as a promising privacy-preserving solution for user-centric identity management. Recent work by Maram et al. proposes the privacy-preserving Sybil-resistant decentralized SSI system CanDID (IEEE S&amp;P 2021). While this is an important step, notable shortcomings undermine its efficacy. The two most significant among them being the following: First, unlinkability breaks in the presence of a single malicious issuer. Second, it introduces interactiveness, as the users are required to communicate each time with issuers to collect credentials intended for use in interactions with applications. This contradicts the goal of SSI, whose aim is to give users full control over their identities. This paper first introduces the concept of publicly verifiable attribute-based threshold anonymous counting tokens (tACT). Unlike recent approaches confined to centralized settings (Benhamouda et al., ASIACRYPT 2023), tACT operates in a distributed-trust environment. Accompanied by a formal security model and a provably secure instantiation, tACT introduces a novel dimension to token issuance, which, we believe, holds independent interest. Next, the paper leverages the proposed tACT scheme to construct an efficient Sybil-resistant SSI system. This system supports various functionalities, including threshold issuance, unlinkable multi-show selective disclosure, and non-interactive, non-transferable credentials that offer constant-size credentials. Finally, our benchmark results show an efficiency improvement in our construction when compared to CanDID all while accommodating a greater number of issuers and additionally reducing to a one-round protocol that can be run in parallel with all issuers.

<title>Nakamoto Consensus under Bounded Processing Capacity</title>

<div> 关键词：Nakamoto共识、Proof-of-Work（PoW）、Proof-of-Stake（PoS）、block production rate、security-performance tradeoff。

总结:<br />
Nakamoto共识协议在有限资源网络中的安全性与性能之间存在经典问题。传统分析忽视了节点处理块的速率限制导致的拥堵。本文提出新的分析方法，揭示了在带宽受限模型中，与经典模型不同，私人攻击不再是最糟情况，而一种名为“逗弄策略”的新攻击更糟。对于PoS，equivocation会加剧拥堵，使得传统PoS NC在高生产率下不安全。为此，作者提出Blanking NC（BlaNC），它能提供与PoW NC相同的抗攻击性，同时解决拥堵问题。 <div>
For Nakamoto's longest-chain consensus protocol, whose proof-of-work (PoW) and proof-of-stake (PoS) variants power major blockchains such as Bitcoin and Cardano, we revisit the classic problem of the security--performance tradeoff: Given a network of nodes with finite communication- and computation-resources, against what fraction of adversary power is Nakamoto consensus (NC) secure for a given block production rate? State-of-the-art analyses of NC fail to answer this question, because their bounded-delay model does not capture the rate limits to nodes' processing of blocks, which cause congestion when blocks are released in quick succession. We develop a new analysis technique to prove a refined security--performance tradeoff for PoW NC in a bounded-capacity model. In this model, we show that, in contrast to the classic bounded-delay model, Nakamoto's private attack is no longer the worst attack, and a new attack we call the teasing strategy, that exploits congestion, is strictly worse. In PoS, equivocating blocks can exacerbate congestion, making traditional PoS NC insecure except at very low block production rates. To counter such equivocation spamming, we present a variant of PoS NC we call Blanking NC (BlaNC), which achieves the same resilience as PoW NC.

<title>Security-Performance Tradeoff in DAG-based Proof-of-Work Blockchain Protocols</title>

总结:
这篇文章探讨了基于DAG的PoW区块链协议在高吞吐量环境下的安全性和性能。通过引入CBM模型，研究者分析了同时存在的块和复杂依赖如何影响延迟。他们设计了一种攻击策略——late-predecessor攻击，利用块间的依赖延迟诚实块的处理。针对Prism和OHIE两个旨在打破安全性能权衡的协议，研究发现它们在高吞吐量下会面临降级的安全性以及延长的延迟，这类似于传统的链式协议。 <div>
Proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain protocols based on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) have demonstrated superior transaction confirmation performance compared to their chain-based predecessors. However, it is uncertain whether their security deteriorates in high-throughput settings similar to their predecessors, because their acceptance of simultaneous blocks and complex block dependencies presents challenges for rigorous security analysis.

We address these challenges by analyzing DAG-based protocols via a congestible blockchain model (CBM), a general model that allows case-by-case upper bounds on the block propagation delay, rather than a uniform upper bound as in most previous analyses. CBM allows us to capture two key phenomena of high-throughput settings: (1) simultaneous blocks increase each other's propagation delay, and (2) a block can be processed only after receiving all the blocks it refers to. We further devise a reasonable adversarial block propagation strategy in CBM, called the late-predecessor attack, which exploits block dependencies to delay the processing of honest blocks. We then evaluate the security and performance of Prism and OHIE, two DAG-based protocols that aim to break the security-performance tradeoff, in the presence of an attacker capable of launching the late predecessor attack. Our results show that these protocols suffer from reduced security and extended latency in high-throughput settings similar to their chain-based predecessors.
