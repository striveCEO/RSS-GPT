<div> 关键词：MUSES、多写入、隐私保护、高效搜索、分布式加密协议

总结:

本文提出了一种名为MUSES的新颖多写者加密搜索平台，旨在解决现有加密搜索设计的功能性、安全性和性能限制。MUSES支持单一阅读者、多写者功能，并允许权限撤销，同时隐藏所有统计信息（包括搜索、结果和体积模式），并保持用户开销极小。

具体而言，MUSES通过集成分布式点函数、分布式PRF和盲线性群操作等新兴分布式加密协议，实现了其独特功能。此外，还引入了适用于一般多方设置（包括多数欺诈）的盲计数和算术分享上的盲洗牌的新型分布式协议，这些技术在其他应用中也具有潜在价值。

实验结果显示，使用MUSES进行关键词搜索的速度比最先进的方法快两个数量级，同时用户带宽成本降低了高达97倍。这表明MUSES在多写者加密搜索领域提供了一种高效、安全且用户负担轻的解决方案。 <div>
Searchable encrypted systems enable privacy-preserving keyword search on encrypted data. Symmetric systems achieve high efficiency (e.g., sublinear search), but they mostly support single-user search. Although systems based on public-key or hybrid models support multi-user search, they incur inherent security weaknesses (e.g., keyword-guessing vulnerabilities) and scalability limitations due to costly public-key operations (e.g., pairing). More importantly, most encrypted search designs leak statistical information (e.g., search, result, and volume patterns) and thus are vulnerable to devastating leakage-abuse attacks. Some pattern-hiding schemes were proposed. However, they incur significant user bandwidth/computation costs, and thus are not desirable for large-scale outsourced databases with resource-constrained users. 
In this paper, we propose MUSES, a new multi-writer encrypted search platform that addresses the functionality, security, and performance limitations in the existing encrypted search designs. Specifically, MUSES permits single-reader, multi-writer functionalities with permission revocation and hides all statistical information (including search, result, and volume patterns) while featuring minimal user overhead. In MUSES, we demonstrate a unique incorporation of various emerging distributed cryptographic protocols including Distributed Point Function, Distributed PRF, and Oblivious Linear Group Action. We also introduce novel distributed protocols for oblivious counting and shuffling on arithmetic shares for the general multi-party setting with a dishonest majority, which can be found useful in other applications. Our experimental results showed that the keyword search by MUSES is two orders of magnitude faster with up to 97× lower user bandwidth cost than the state-of-the-art.

<div> 关键词：Encrypted Computation、Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)、Searchable Symmetric Encryption (SSE)、Symmetric Encrypted Computation (SEC)、Arbitrary Boolean Circuit Evaluations

<br />
<br />总结:
本文探讨了使用搜索对称加密（SSE）进行对称加密数据上的任意布尔电路评估的高效方法，进而提出了一种名为对称加密计算（SEC）的新方法。SEC是一种基于对称密钥加密原语的实用和可证明安全的查找基础构造，能够支持对对称加密数据执行任意布尔电路的评估，同时扩展并概括了SSE的功能能力，继承了其数据隐私保证和性能优势。

SEC依赖于纯对称密钥密码学原语，实现了灵活的性能与泄漏之间的权衡。相较于传统的全同态加密（FHE），SEC在基本布尔门操作评估中提供了大约1000倍的速度提升，并在处理具有多比特输入的功能时表现出良好的可扩展性，如对AES-128电路和AlexNet架构中的三个最大池化层的加密评估。在这些实验中，SEC在处理时间上比最先进的FHE实现高出1000倍，而存储成本仅增加了250倍。 <div>
Encrypted computation allows a client to securely outsource the storage and processing of sensitive private data to an untrusted third party cloud server. Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) allows computing arbitrary functions over encrypted data, but incurs huge overheads and does not practically scale to large databases. Whereas, slightly weaker yet efficient constructions- Searchable Symmetric Encryption (SSE) support lookup-based evaluations of a restricted class of Boolean circuits over symmetrically encrypted data. In this paper, we investigate the use of SSE to efficiently perform arbitrary Boolean circuit evaluations over symmetrically encrypted data via look-ups. To this end, in this work, we propose Symmetric Encrypted Computation (SEC): the first practically efficient and provably secure lookup-based construction, analogous
to traditional FHE, that supports evaluation of arbitrary Boolean circuits over symmetrically encrypted data. SEC relies on purely symmetric-key cryptoprimitives and achieves flexible performance versus leakage trade-offs. SEC extends and generalizes the functional capabilities of SSE, while inheriting its data privacy guarantees and desirable performance benefits. We provide a concrete construction of SEC and analyze its security with respect to a rigorously defined and thoroughly analyzed leakage profile. We also present a prototype implementation of SEC and experimentally validate its practical efficiency. Our experiments show that SEC outperforms state-of-the-art FHE schemes (such as Torus FHE) substantially, with around 1000× speed-up in basic Boolean gate evaluations. We further showcase the scalability of SEC for functions
with multi-bit inputs via experiments performing encrypted evaluation of the entire AES-128 circuit, as well as three max-pooling layers of AlexNet architecture. For both sets of experiments, SEC outperforms state-of-the-art and accelerated FHE implementations by 1000× in terms of processing time, while incurring 250× lower storage.

<div> 关键词：隐私保护、神经网络、安全多方计算（MPC）、通信效率、安全训练与推理

总结:

本文介绍了一种基于安全多方计算（MPC）的高效通信隐私保护神经网络框架——FssNN。该框架旨在解决传统方法中由于非线性函数安全计算导致的高通信成本问题。FssNN提出了减小密钥大小的关键方案，通过分析DCF密钥之间的相关性，设计了具有紧凑加性构造的密钥缩减DCF方案，这显著减少了密钥大小和离线通信成本。此外，通过利用MPC友好的伪随机数生成器，FssNN设计了一个无信任第三方参与的分布式密钥生成协议，进一步提高了系统的实用性。

在FssNN中，非线性和线性函数分别使用密钥缩减DCF和加性秘密共享进行计算，设计了具有常数在线通信轮次的安全计算协议，显著降低了在线通信成本。最后，文章提供了形式化的安全性证明，并在各种模型和数据集上进行了性能评估，结果表明，与最先进的框架AriaNN相比，FssNN在安全训练和推理阶段的总通信成本分别降低了约25.4%和26.4%。

通过上述改进，FssNN不仅提高了通信效率，还增强了系统的实用性，为在分布式环境中安全有效地训练和推理神经网络提供了有力的支持。 <div>
Privacy-preserving neural network based on secure multi-party computation (MPC) enables multiple parties to jointly train neural network models without revealing sensitive data. In privacy-preserving neural network, the high communication costs of securely computing non-linear functions is the primary performance bottleneck. For commonly used non-linear functions, such as ReLU, existing work adopts an offline-online computation paradigm and utilizes distributed comparison function (DCF) to reduce communication costs. Specifically, these works prepare DCF keys in the offline phase and perform secure ReLU using these DCF keys in the online phase. However, the practicality of existing work is significantly limited due to the substantial size of DCF keys and the heavy reliance on a trusted third party in the offline phase.

In this work, we introduce a communication-efficient secure two-party neural network framework called FssNN, which proposes a key-reduced DCF scheme without a trusted third party to enable practical secure training and inference. First, by analyzing the correlations between DCF keys to eliminate redundant parameters, we propose a key-reduced DCF scheme with a compact additive construction, which decreases the size of DCF keys by about $17.9\%$ and the offline communication costs by approximately $28.0\%$. Secondly, by leveraging an MPC-friendly pseudorandom number generator, we propose a secure two-party distributed key generation protocol for our key-reduced DCF, thereby eliminating the reliance on the trusted third party. Finally, we utilize the key-reduced DCF and additive secret sharing to compute non-linear and linear functions, respectively, and design secure computation protocols with constant online communication rounds for neural network operators, reducing the online communication costs by $28.9\% \sim 43.4\%$.

We provide formal security proofs and evaluate the performance of FssNN on various models and datasets. Experimental results show that compared to the state-of-the-art framework AriaNN, our framework reduces the total communication costs of secure training and inference by approximately $25.4\%$ and $26.4\%$ respectively.

<title>The Espresso Sequencing Network: HotShot Consensus, Tiramisu Data-Availability, and Builder-Exchange</title>
<link>https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/1189</link>
<guid>https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/1189</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Building a Consensus platform for shared sequencing can power an ecosystem of layer-2 solutions such as rollups which are crucial for scaling blockchains (e.g.,Ethereum). However, it drastically differs from conventional Consensus for blockchains in two key considerations:
• (No) Execution: A shared sequencing platform is not responsible for pre-validating blocks nor for processing state updates. Therefore, agreement is formed on a sequence of certificates of block data-availability (DA) without persisting them or obtaining blocks in full. At the same time, the platform must stream block data with very high efficiency to layer-2 entities for execution, or (in the case of rollups) for proof generation.
• Builder-Exchange: A shared sequencing platform delegates to external entities to build blocks and separates it from the role of a consensus proposer. This allows an ecosystem of specialized builders to pre-validate transactions for diversified rollups, languages, and MEV exploits. However, separating the task of block-building from proposing brings a new challenge. Builders want assurances that their blocks would commit in exchange for revealing their contents, whereas validators/proposers want assurance that the data in committed blocks will be available and fees paid. Neither one trusts the other, hence the shared sequencing platform should facilitate a “fair-exchange”  between builders and the sequencing network. The Espresso Sequencing Network is purpose-built to address these unique considerations.
Among the main novelties of the design are (i) a three-layered DA system called Tiramisu, coupled with (ii) a costless integration of the DA with the platform’s consensus core, and (iii) a Builder-Exchange mechanism between builders and the consensus core.
Note that this paper relies substantially on and can be seen as an extension of The Espresso Sequencer: HotShot Consensus and Tiramisu Data Availability [84].

<title>Hyperion: Transparent End-to-End Verifiable Voting with Coercion Mitigation</title>
<link>https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/1182</link>
<guid>https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/1182</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present Hyperion, an end-to-end verifiable e-voting scheme that allows the voters to identify their votes in cleartext in the final tally. In contrast to schemes like Selene or sElect, identification is not via (private) tracker numbers but via cryptographic commitment terms. After publishing the tally, the Election Authority provides each voter with an individual dual key. Voters identify their votes by raising their dual key to their secret trapdoor key and finding the matching commitment term in the tally. 
The dual keys are self-certifying in that, without the voter's trapdoor key, it is intractable to forge a dual key that, when raised to the trapdoor key, will match an alternative commitment. On the other hand, a voter can use their own trapdoor key to forge a dual key to fool any would-be coercer.
Additionally, we propose a variant of Hyperion that counters the tracker collision threat present in Selene. We introduce individual verifiable views: each voter gets their own independently shuffled view of the master Bulletin Board. 
We provide new improved definitions of privacy and verifiability for e-voting schemes and prove the scheme secure against these, as well as proving security with respect to earlier definitions in the literature.
Finally, we provide a prototype implementation and provide measurements which demonstrate that our scheme is practical for large scale elections.

<title>AQQUA: Augmenting Quisquis with Auditability</title>
<link>https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/1181</link>
<guid>https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/1181</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We propose AQQUA: a digital payment system that combines auditability and privacy. AQQUA extends Quisquis by adding two authorities; one for registration and one for auditing. These authorities do not intervene in the everyday transaction processing; as a consequence, the decentralized nature of the cryptocurrency is not disturbed. Our construction is account-based. An account consists of an updatable public key which functions as a cryptographically unlinkable pseudonym, and of commitments to the balance, the total amount of coins spent, and the total amount of coins received. In order to participate in the system a user creates an initial account with the registration authority. To protect their privacy, whenever the user wants to transact they create unlinkable new accounts by updating their public key and the total number of accounts they own (maintained in committed form). The audit authority may request an audit at will. The user must prove in zero-knowledge that all their accounts are compliant to  specific policies. We formally define a security model capturing the properties that a private and auditable digital payment system should possess and we analyze the security of AQQUA under this model.

<title>Post-quantum XML and SAML Single Sign-On</title>
<link>https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/828</link>
<guid>https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/828</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Extensible Markup Language (XML) is one of the most popular serialization languages. Since many security protocols are built using XML, it also provides cryptographic functionality. A central framework in this area is the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML). This standard is one of the most widely used options for implementing Single Sign-On (SSO), which allows users to authenticate to different service providers using the credentials from a single identity provider. Like all other security protocols currently in use, the security and privacy of XML-based frameworks such as SAML is threatened by the development of increasingly powerful quantum computers. In fact, future attackers with access to scalable quantum computers will be able to break the currently used cryptographic building blocks and thus undermine the security of the SAML SSO to illegally access sensitive private information. Post-quantum cryptography algorithms have been developed to protect against such quantum attackers. While many security protocols have been migrated into the quantum age by using post-quantum cryptography, no such solutions for XML and the security protocols based on it have been developed, let alone tested. We make the following contributions to fill this gap. We have designed post-quantum solutions for the cryptographic building blocks in XML and integrated them into the SAML SSO protocol. We implemented our solutions in the OpenSAML, Apache Santuario, and BouncyCastle libraries and extensively tested their performance for various post-quantum instantiations. As a result, we have created a comprehensive and solid foundation for post-quantum XML and post-quantum SAML SSO migration.

<title>Succinctly-Committing Authenticated Encryption</title>
<link>https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/875</link>
<guid>https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/875</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Recent attacks and applications have led to the need for symmetric encryption schemes that, in addition to providing the usual authenticity and privacy, are also committing. In response, many committing authenticated encryption schemes have been proposed. However, all known schemes, in order to provide s bits of committing security, suffer an expansion---this is the length of the ciphertext minus the length of the plaintext---of 2s bits. This incurs a cost in bandwidth or storage. (We typically want s=128, leading to 256-bit expansion.) However, it has been considered unavoidable due to birthday attacks. We show how to bypass this limitation. We give authenticated encryption (AE) schemes that provide s bits of committing security, yet suffer expansion only around s as long as messages are long enough, namely more than s bits. We call such schemes succinct. We do this via a generic, ciphertext-shortening transform called SC: given an AE scheme with 2s-bit expansion, SC returns an AE scheme with s-bit expansion while preserving committing security. SC is very efficient; an AES-based instantiation has overhead just two AES calls. As a tool, SC uses a collision-resistant invertible PRF called HtM, that we design, and whose analysis is technically difficult. To add the committing security that SC assumes to a base scheme, we also give a transform CTY that improves Chan and Rogaway's CTX. Our results hold in a general framework for authenticated encryption, called AE3, that includes both AE1 (also called AEAD) and AE2 (also called nonce-hiding AE) as special cases, so that we in particular obtain succinctly-committing AE schemes for both these settings.

<title>Linea Prover Documentation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Rollup technology today promises long-term solutions to the scalability of the blockchain. Among a thriving ecosystem, Consensys has launched the Linea zkEVM Rollup network for Ethereum. 

At a high level, the Ethereum blockchain can be seen as a state machine and its state transition can be arithmetized carefully. Linea's prover protocol uses this arithmetization, along with transactions on layer two in order to compute a cryptographic proof that the state transition is performed correctly. 

The proof is then sent over to the Ethereum layer, where the smart contract (verifier contract) on Ethereum checks the proof and accepts the state transition if the proof is valid. The interaction between layer two and Ethereum is costly, which imposes substantial limitations on the proof size. Therefore, Linea's prover aims to compress the proof via cryptographic tools such as list polynomial commitments (LPCs), polynomial interactive oracle proofs (PIOPs), and Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge (SNARKs).

We introduce Wizard-IOP, a cryptographic tool for handling a wide class of queries (such as range checks, scalar products, permutations checks, etc.) needed to ensure the correctness of the executions of the state machines efficiently and conveniently. Another cryptographic tool is the Arcane compiler, which outputs standard PIOPs and is employed by Wizard-IOP to make different queries homogeneous. After applying Arcane, all the queries constitute evaluation queries over the polynomials. We then apply the Unique Evaluation compiler (UniEval), which receives the output of the Arcane and provides us with a PIOP that requires only a single evaluation check. 

At this point, we employ Vortex, a list polynomial commitment (LPC) scheme to convert the resulting PIOP into an argument of knowledge. The argument of knowledge is then made succinct by applying different techniques such as self-recursion, standard recursion, and proof aggregations.

<div> 关键词：Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC), Blockchain, IoT, Embedded Systems, Quantum-Safe

总结: <br />
文章探讨了区块链技术在依赖公钥加密的背景下对量子计算威胁的脆弱性。为解决这一问题，作者提出将后量子密码学(PQC)融入区块链框架，以增强安全性与韧性，特别针对物联网(IoT)和嵌入式系统。研究着重于PQC在嵌入式环境中的实现，如NIST标准中的算法。通过优化交易大小，如使用Falcon的公钥恢复技术，可减少交易体积高达17%。Falcon-512和XMSS被推荐为量子安全区块链的合适选项，但Dilithium在嵌入式设备上的TPS更高。此外，文章还讨论了智能合约功能与PQC结合的影响。总的来说，研究证实了在嵌入式系统中部署量子安全区块链的可行性，为构建未来-proof的IoT应用提供了坚实基础。 <div>
Blockchain technology ensures accountability,
transparency, and redundancy in critical applications, includ-
ing IoT with embedded systems. However, the reliance on
public-key cryptography (PKC) makes blockchain vulnerable to
quantum computing threats. This paper addresses the urgent
need for quantum-safe blockchain solutions by integrating Post-
Quantum Cryptography (PQC) into blockchain frameworks.
Utilizing algorithms from the NIST PQC standardization pro-
cess, we aim to fortify blockchain security and resilience, partic-
ularly for IoT and embedded systems. Despite the importance
of PQC, its implementation in blockchain systems tailored for
embedded environments remains underexplored. We propose
a quantum-secure blockchain architecture, evaluating various
PQC primitives and optimizing transaction sizes through tech-
niques such as public-key recovery for Falcon, achieving up
to 17% reduction in transaction size. Our analysis identifies
Falcon-512 as the most suitable algorithm for quantum-secure
blockchains in embedded environments, with XMSS as a viable
stateful alternative. However, for embedded devices, Dilithium
demonstrates a higher transactions-per-second (TPS) rate
compared to Falcon, primarily due to Falcon’s slower sign-
ing performance on ARM CPUs. This highlights the signing
time as a critical limiting factor in the integration of PQC
within embedded blockchains. Additionally, we integrate smart
contract functionality into the quantum-secure blockchain,
assessing the impact of PQC on smart contract authentication.
Our findings demonstrate the feasibility and practicality of
deploying quantum-secure blockchain solutions in embedded
systems, paving the way for robust and future-proof IoT
applications.

<title>AVeCQ: Anonymous Verifiable Crowdsourcing with Worker Qualities</title>

<div> 关键词：Crowdsourcing, Anonymity, Unlinkability, Worker Quality, Cryptographic Tools.

总结:<br />
AVeCQ是一个创新的去中心化、隐私保护的众包系统，它结合了增强匿名性和可验证的工人质量更新。该系统利用零知识证明等密码学工具来保障工人隐私，验证答案和评分的准确性，以及公平支付。AVeCQ模块化设计，允许请求者和工人通过支持匿名性、信息记录和支付的平台交互。与现有方案相比，如在图像注解、平均评价和盖洛普民意调查等任务中，AVeCQ表现出更高的效率，包括减少计算和验证证明，以及区块链交易处理的开销，例如在128名工人参与的平均评价任务中，AVeCQ比现有系统快40%，同时请求者的交易消耗降低87%。 <div>
In crowdsourcing systems, requesters publish tasks, and interested workers provide answers to get rewards. Worker anonymity motivates participation since it protects their privacy. Anonymity with unlinkability is an enhanced version of anonymity because it makes it impossible to ``link'' workers across the tasks they participate in. Another core feature of crowdsourcing systems is worker quality which expresses a worker's trustworthiness and quantifies their historical performance. In this work, we present AVeCQ, the first crowdsourcing system that reconciles these properties, achieving enhanced anonymity and verifiable worker quality updates. AVeCQ relies on a suite of cryptographic tools, such as zero-knowledge proofs, to (i) guarantee workers' privacy, (ii) prove the correctness of worker quality scores and task answers, and (iii) commensurate payments. AVeCQ is developed modularly, where requesters and workers communicate over a platform that supports pseudonymity, information logging, and payments. To compare AVeCQ with the state-of-the-art, we prototype it over Ethereum. AVeCQ outperforms the state-of-the-art in three popular crowdsourcing tasks (image annotation, average review, and Gallup polls). E.g., for an Average Review task with 5 choices and 128 workers AVeCQ is 40% faster (including computing and verifying necessary proofs, and blockchain transaction processing overheads) with the task's requester consuming 87% fewer gas.

<div> 关键词：Post-quantum cryptography (PQC), lightweight implementation, resource-constrained devices, lattice-based KEM, area optimization.

总结:<br />
本文关注的是在资源受限的设备中集成后量子密码学（PQC）的挑战。首先，作者提出了一种基于硬晶格问题的轻量级选择密钥封装机制（KEM），以应对这些设备的低内存和低功耗需求。通过精心分析和优化设计元素，如多项式大小、域模结构、还原算法等，新设计在保持100位PQ安全的同时，相比当前标准Kyber KEM，实现了约3倍的面积效率提升。这项工作为PQC在物联网和无线传感器等设备中的应用开辟了新的可能性。 <div>
Resource-constrained devices such as wireless sensors and Internet of Things (IoT) devices have become ubiquitous in our digital ecosystem. These devices generate and handle a major part of our digital data.  In the face of the impending threat of quantum computers on our public-key infrastructure, it is impossible to imagine the security and privacy of our digital world without integrating post-quantum cryptography (PQC) into these devices. Usually, due to the resource constraints of these devices, the cryptographic schemes in these devices have to operate with very small memory and consume very little power. Therefore, we must provide a lightweight implementation of existing PQC schemes by possibly trading off the efficiency. The other option that can potentially provide the most optimal result is by designing PQC schemes suitable for lightweight and low-power-consuming implementation.  Unfortunately, the latter method has been largely ignored in PQC research.

In this work, we first provide a lightweight CCA-secure PQ key-encapsulation mechanism (KEM) design based on hard lattice problems. We have done a scrupulous and extensive analysis and evaluation of different design elements, such as polynomial size, field modulus structure, reduction algorithm, secret and error distribution, etc., of a lattice-based KEM. We have optimized each of them to obtain a lightweight design. Our design provides a $100$ bit of PQ security and shows $\sim3$x improvement in terms of area with respect to the state-of-the-art Kyber KEM, a PQ standard.

<title>Expanding the Toolbox: Coercion and Vote-Selling at Vote-Casting Revisited</title>

<div> 关键词：coercion, vote-buying, electronic voting, remote, blockchain

总结:<br />
本文探讨了电子投票，特别是远程电子投票中面临的胁迫（coercion）和贿赂选票（vote-buying）问题。作者指出，尽管已有抵抗措施，但现有的技术工具如区块链、延迟加密和隐私保护智能合约可能被恶意行为者利用加强这些攻击。文章强调，现有的胁迫模型需要重新评估，提出新的胁迫定义和无收据自由（receipt-freeness）概念。研究者建议在设计新的选举系统时考虑这些新定义，以确保更安全的民主投票环境。 <div>
Coercion is a challenging and multi-faceted threat that prevents people from expressing their will freely. Similarly, vote-buying does to undermine the foundation of free democratic elections. These threats are especially dire for remote electronic voting, which relies on voters to express their political will freely but happens in an uncontrolled environment outside the polling station and the protection of the ballot booth. However, electronic voting in general, both in-booth and remote, faces a major challenge, namely to ensure that voters can verify that their intent is captured correctly without providing a receipt of the cast vote to the coercer or vote buyer.

Even though there are known techniques to resist or partially mitigate coercion and vote-buying, we explicitly demonstrate that they generally underestimate the power of malicious actors by not accounting for current technological tools that could support coercion and vote-selling. 

In this paper, we give several examples of how a coercer can force voters to comply with his demands or how voters can prove how they voted. To do so, we use tools like blockchains, delay encryption, privacy-preserving smart contracts, or trusted hardware. Since some of the successful coercion attacks occur on voting schemes that were supposed/claimed/proven to be coercion-resistant or receipt-free, the main conclusion of this work is that the coercion models should be re-evaluated, and new definitions of coercion and receipt-freeness are necessary. We propose such new definitions as part of this paper and investigate their implications.

<div> 关键词：multi-signature, linear ID, public-key, signature, lattice-based ID

总结: 这篇论文介绍了一种新的方法，将线性标识（linear ID）方案转换为多签名协议，以实现短小的聚合公钥和签名。这种转换器解决了去中心化环境下防止恶意攻击的问题，并优化了区块链上的存储需求。研究者利用两种身份验证方案——Schnorr ID和基于 lattice 的新方案，实现了这一编译器。通过这种方式，他们得到了第一个无需重启签名人过程的常规 lattice 基础多签名方案，同时保持了关键和签名的紧凑性。这种方法简化了多方问题，转而依赖于弱式两方安全问题的解决方案。 <div>
Multi-signature is a protocol where a set of signatures jointly sign a message so that the final signature is significantly shorter than concatenating individual  signatures together. Recently, it finds applications in blockchain, where several users want to jointly authorize a payment through a multi-signature.  However, in this setting, there is no centralized authority and it could suffer from a rogue key attack where the attacker can generate his own keys arbitrarily. Further, to minimize the storage on blockchain, it is desired that the aggregated  public-key and the aggregated signature are both as short as possible. In this paper,  we find a compiler that converts a kind  of identification (ID) scheme (which we call a linear ID) to a multi-signature so that both the aggregated  public-key and the aggregated signature have a  size independent of the number of signers. Our compiler is provably secure. The advantage of our results is that we reduce a multi-party problem to a weakly secure two-party problem.  We realize our compiler with two ID schemes. The first is  Schnorr ID. The second is a new lattice-based ID scheme,  which via our compiler gives the first regular lattice-based multi-signature scheme with  key-and-signature compact without a restart during signing process.

<div> 关键词：location tracking, privacy guarantees, tracker-based stalking, abuse-resistant offline finding protocols, multi-dealer secret sharing

总结:<br />文章探讨了位置追踪附件（如Apple和Samsung销售的跟踪标签）的隐私问题。这些设备设计初衷是为了保护用户隐私，但现实中却面临$\textit{tracker-based stalking}$（跟踪式骚扰）的问题。为平衡隐私和对跟踪行为的识别，提出了$\textit{abuse-resistant offline finding protocols}$（抗滥用离线查找协议）。作者提出了一种高效协议，利用$\textit{multi-dealer secret sharing}$（多经销商秘密共享）这一新型隐私增强工具，结合Interleaved Reed-Solomon代码和新的 lattice-based decoding算法，实现在保护用户隐私的同时有效检测跟踪者。这一成果对于边缘设备的高效实现具有重要意义。 <div>
Location tracking accessories (or "tracking tags") such as those sold by Apple, Samsung, and Tile, allow owners to track the location of their property via offline finding networks. The tracking protocols were designed to ensure that no entity (including the vendor) can use a tag's broadcasts to surveil its owner. These privacy guarantees, however, seem to be at odds with the  phenomenon of $\textit{tracker-based stalking}$, where attackers use these very tags to monitor a target's movements. Numerous such criminal incidents have been reported, and in response, manufacturers have chosen to substantially weaken privacy guarantees in order to allow users to detect stalker tags. This compromise has been adopted in a recent IETF draft jointly proposed by Apple and Google. 
 

We put forth the notion of $\textit{abuse-resistant offline finding protocols}$ that aim to achieve a better balance between user privacy and stalker detection. We present an efficient protocol that achieves stalker detection under realistic conditions without sacrificing honest user privacy. At the heart of our result, and of independent interest, is a new notion of $\textit{multi-dealer secret sharing}$ which strengthens standard secret sharing with novel privacy and correctness guarantees. We show that this primitive can be instantiated efficiently on edge devices using variants of Interleaved Reed-Solomon codes combined with new lattice-based decoding algorithms.

<div> 关键词：Private Information Retrieval（PIR）、Communication Overhead、Database、Small Records、Lattice-Based Scheme。

总结:<br />本文介绍了一种名为Respire的新型基于 lattice 的隐私信息检索（PIR）方案，特别针对小记录数据库设计。与现有最高效方案相比，Respire在下载单个记录时的在线通信量减少了5.9倍，仅需6.1KB。此外，Respire支持批量查询，相比先前高效通信的批处理PIR方案，它在总通信上降低了3.4-7.1倍，同时保持了相近的吞吐量（200-400MB/s）。其设计创新之处在于运用了新的查询压缩和响应打包技术，这些技术基于同态加密中的环切换。 <div>
Private information retrieval (PIR) is a key building block in many privacy-preserving systems, and recent works have made significant progress on reducing the concrete computational costs of single-server PIR. However, existing constructions have high communication overhead, especially for databases with small records. In this work, we introduce Respire, a lattice-based PIR scheme tailored for databases of small records. To retrieve a single record from a database with over a million 256-byte records, the Respire protocol requires just 6.1 KB of online communication; this is a 5.9x reduction compared to the best previous lattice-based scheme. Moreover, Respire naturally extends to support batch queries. Compared to previous communication-efficient batch PIR schemes, Respire achieves a 3.4-7.1x reduction in total communication while maintaining comparable throughput (200-400 MB/s). The design of Respire relies on new query compression and response packing techniques based on ring switching in homomorphic encryption.

<div> 关键词：Auditing, Organizations, Ledgers, Security, Scalability

总结:<br />本文主要探讨了审计在财政年度对交易活跃组织的重要性，以及当前审计过程中存在的挑战。为解决大量组织数据核查的计算问题，作者提出CLOSC和CLOLC两种协议，旨在确保不同账本之间的交易一致性，同时保护交易金额、组织与审计者之间的匿名性和交易组织间的隐私。这两种协议基于两层账本架构和加密工具，实现了高效安全的审计。文章通过性能评估显示，即使处理百万级交易，计算和验证时间也能保持在秒级别，而单个审计周期的链上存储成本也非常合理。 <div>
Auditing throughout a fiscal year is integral to organizations with transactional activity. Organizations transact with each other and record the details for all their economical activities so that a regulatory committee can verify the lawfulness and legitimacy of their activity. However, it is computationally infeasible for the committee to perform all necessary checks for each organization. To overcome this, auditors assist in this process: organizations give access to all their internal data to their auditors, who then produce reports regarding the consistency of the organization's data, alerting the committee to any inconsistencies. Despite this, numerous issues that result in fines annually revolve around such inconsistencies in bookkeeping across organizations. Notably, committees wishing to verify the correctness of auditor-provided reports need to redo all their calculations; a process which is computationally proportional to the number of organizations. In fact, it becomes prohibitive when considering real-world settings with thousands of organizations. In this work, we propose two protocols, CLOSC and CLOLC, whose goals are to enable auditors and a committee to verify the consistency of transactions across different ledgers. Both protocols ensure that for every transaction recorded in an organization's ledger, there exists a dual one in the ledger of another organization while safeguarding against other potential attacks. Importantly, we minimize the information leakage to auditors and other organizations and guarantee three crucial security and privacy properties that we propose: (i) transaction amount privacy, (ii) organization-auditor unlinkability, and (iii) transacting organizations unlinkability. At the core of our protocols lies a two-tier ledger architecture alongside a suite of cryptographic tools. To demonstrate the practicality and scalability of our designs, we provide extensive performance evaluation for both CLOSC and CLOLC. Our numbers are promising, i.e., all computation and verification times lie in the range of seconds, even for millions of transactions, while the on-chain storage costs for an auditing epoch are encouraging i.e. in the range of GB for millions of transactions and thousands of organizations.

<div> 关键词：blockchain systems, transaction inclusion policy, fee predictability, delay predictability, incentive compatibility

总结: 
本文关注区块链系统的交易拥堵问题，特别是如何在保证安全性和去中心化的同时实现交易费用和延迟的可预测性。传统方法如拍卖或动态调整费用存在矛盾。为此，作者提出区块链空间令牌化（BST）的概念，允许用户预付费锁定一段时间内的交易能力，以提高交易的确定性和抗攻击性。文章通过安全游戏模型分析了BST机制，证明它能提供可预测的最优延迟、费用以及激励兼容性，从而正面回答了研究中的问题。 <div>
Handling congestion in blockchain systems is a fundamental problem given that the security and decentralization objectives of such systems lead to designs that compromise on (horizontal) scalability (what sometimes is referred to as the ``blockchain trilemma''). Motivated by this, we focus on the question whether it is possible to design a  transaction inclusion policy for block producers  that facilitates  fee and delay predictability while being incentive compatible at the same time. 


Reconciling these three properties is seemingly paradoxical given that the dominant approach to transaction processing is based on first-price auctions (e.g., as in Bitcoin) or dynamic adjustment of the minimum admissible fee (e.g. as in Ethereum EIP-1559) something that breaks fee predictability. At the same time, in fixed fee mechanisms (e.g., as in Cardano),  fees are trivially predictable but are subject to  relatively inexpensive bribing or denial of service attacks where transactions may be delayed indefinitely by a well funded attacker, hence breaking delay predictability.  

In this work, we set out to address this problem by putting forward blockchain space tokenization (BST), namely a new capability of a blockchain system to tokenize its capacity for transactions and allocate it to interested users who are willing to pay ahead of time for the ability to post transactions regularly for a period of time. We analyze our system in the face of  worst-case transaction-processing attacks by introducing a security game played between the mempool mechanism and an adversary.  Leveraging this framework, we prove that BST offers predictable and asymptotically optimal delays, predictable fees, and is incentive compatible, thus answering the question posed in the affirmative.

总结: <br />
文章探讨了在联邦学习中进行数据去重（deduplication）的重要性和挑战。为解决这一问题，作者提出了一种创新协议：高效隐私保护多方去重（EP-MPD）。EP-MPD通过两个新型的私密集合交集协议模块构建，实现了在保护数据隐私的同时，从多个客户端数据集中高效去除重复项。实验结果表明，去重显著提高了大型语言模型的联邦学习性能，如降低 perplexity 达19.61%，并减少运行时间高达27.95%。EP-MPD在联邦学习中兼顾了隐私和效率，为大规模应用提供了有价值解决方案。 <div>
Deduplication is a vital preprocessing step that enhances machine learning model performance and saves training time and energy. However, enhancing federated learning through deduplication poses challenges, especially regarding scalability and potential privacy violations if deduplication involves sharing all clients’ data. In this paper, we address the problem of deduplication in a federated setup by introducing a pioneering protocol, Efficient Privacy-Preserving Multi-Party Deduplication (EP-MPD). It efficiently removes duplicates from multiple clients’ datasets without compromising data privacy. EP-MPD is constructed in a modular fashion, utilizing two novel variants of the Private Set Intersection protocol. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the significant benefits of deduplication in federated learning of large language models. For instance, we observe up to 19.61% improvement in perplexity and up to 27.95% reduction in running time. EP-MPD effectively balances privacy and performance in federated learning, making it a valuable solution for large-scale applications.

<div> 关键词：Privacy-preserving, Decision tree evaluation, Non-interactive, Batched, Speedup

总结: <br />
本文提出两种新型非交互式批量隐私保护决策树评估（PDTE）协议：OursRCC和OursCW，分别基于批量加密值与单个明文值的比较算法——批量范围覆盖比较器（RCC）和常数权重片段比较器（CW）。相较于最先进的Level Up（CCS'23），它们在16位批量加密值比较中速度提升高达72倍。此外，作者创新了适应性SumPath树遍历方法，降低了服务器响应的复杂度至$\mathcal{O}(1)$，而Level Up为$\mathcal{O}(2^d)$，且客户端查询效率提高。总的来说，新提出的PDTE协议具有最优的服务器到客户端通信复杂度，对于批量大小16384，速度提升可达17倍。 <div>
Privacy-preserving decision tree evaluation (PDTE) allows a client that holds feature vectors to perform inferences against a decision tree model on the server side without revealing feature vectors to the server. Our work focuses on the non-interactive batched setting where the client sends a batch of encrypted feature vectors and then obtains classifications, without any additional interaction. This is useful in privacy-preserving credit scoring, biometric authentication, and many more applications.

In this paper, we propose two novel non-interactive batched PDTE protocols, OursRCC and OursCW, based on two batched ciphertext-plaintext comparison algorithms, our batched range cover comparison (RCC) comparator and the constant-weight (CW) piece-wise comparator, respectively. When comparing 16-bit batched encrypted values to a single plaintext value, our comparison algorithms show a speedup of up to $72\times$ compared to the state-of-the-art Level Up (CCS'23). Moreover, we introduced a new tree traversal method called adapted SumPath, to achieve $\mathcal{O}(1)$ complexity of the server's response, whereas Level Up has $\mathcal{O}(2^d)$ complexity for a depth-$d$ tree and the client needs to look up classification values in a table.

Overall, our PDTE protocols attain the optimal server-to-client communication complexity and are up to $17\times$ faster than Level Up in batch size 16384.

<title>Identity-Based Matchmaking Encryption, Revisited: Improved Constructions with Strong Security</title>

<div> 关键词：Identity-based matchmaking encryption (IB-ME), Security definitions, Privacy, Authentication, Constructions.

总结:<br />
这篇论文主要探讨了身份匹配加密（IB-ME）的安全性定义和构造。首先，它对现有IB-ME的安全概念进行了分类，将隐私分为三种类型（对称、选择性和解密错误时的隐私）和四种类型的认证（内部和外部的非冒充和强认证）。作者提出了一种新的“解密错误安全”游戏，以更好地理解这种特殊情况下的隐私保护。其次，论文提供了两种高效且强安全的IB-ME方案：一种基于Boneh-Franklin IBE，具有更紧凑的密钥和更强大的安全性；另一种是通用构造，提供最短的密文和更强的保障，适用于各种假设，如标准模型中的对称外部Diffie-Hellman假设和量子随机Oracle模型中的 lattice。这些改进增强了IB-ME的实用性和安全性。 <div>
Identity-based matchmaking encryption (IB-ME) [Ateniese et al. Crypto 2019] allows users to communicate privately in an anonymous and authenticated manner. After the seminal paper by Ateniese et al., a lot of work has been done on the security and construction of IB-ME. In this work, we revisit the security definitions of IB-ME and provide improved constructions of it. First, we classify the existing security notions of IB-ME, systematically categorizing privacy into three categories (CPA, CCA, and privacy in the case of mismatch) and authenticity into four categories (NMA and CMA both against insiders and outsiders).In particular, we reconsider the privacy when the sender's identity is mismatched during decryption, and provide a new simple security game, called mismatch security, capturing the essence of it. Second, we propose efficient and strongly secure IB-ME schemes from the bilinear Diffie-Hellman assumption in the random oracle model and from anonymous identity-based encryption, identity-based signature, and reusable extractors in the standard model. The first scheme is based on Boneh-Franklin IBE similar to the Ateniese et al. scheme, but ours achieves a more compact decryption key and ciphertext and stronger CCA-privacy, CMA-authenticity, and mismatch security. The second scheme is an improved generic construction, which active not only stronger security but also the shortest ciphertext among existing generic constructions.  Through this construction, we obtain, for example, a more efficient scheme from the symmetric external Diffie-Hellman assumption in the standard model, and a practical scheme from lattices in the quantum random oracle model.

<div> 关键词：Partially Oblivious Pseudorandom Functions (POPRFs), Lattice Assumptions, Crypto Dark Matter PRF, Random Oracle Model, Torus Fully Homomorphic Encryption (TFHE).

总结:<br />
本文提出了一种新颖的基于 lattice 假设和 Crypto Dark Matter PRF 的 Partially Oblivious Pseudorandom Functions (POPRF) 构造，该方案利用了 TFHE 中的混合模计算和可编程提升。它提供了恶意客户端安全性和客户端隐私保护，分别基于电路私有 FHE 和 FHE 方案的语义安全性。此外，作者探索了通过低深度计算欺骗电路的难度来实现可验证性的方法，从而得到可验证的 (P)OPRF。文章提供了原型实现和初步性能指标，核心在线 OPRF 功能的通信成本为每次评估10.0KB，客户端一次性设置通信为2.5MB。 <div>
Partially Oblivious Pseudorandom Functions (POPRFs) are 2-party protocols that allow a client to learn pseudorandom function (PRF) evaluations on inputs of its choice from a server. The client submits two inputs, one public and one private. The security properties ensure that the server cannot learn the private input, and the client cannot learn more than one evaluation per POPRF query. POPRFs have many applications including password-based key exchange and privacy-preserving authentication mechanisms. However, most constructions are based on classical assumptions, and those with post quantum security suffer from large eﬀiciency drawbacks.

In this work, we construct a novel POPRF from lattice assumptions and the “Crypto Dark Matter” PRF candidate (TCC’18) in the random oracle model. At a conceptual level, our scheme exploits the alignment of this family of PRF candidates, relying on mixed modulus computations, and programmable bootstrapping in the torus fully homomorphic encryption scheme (TFHE). We show that our construction achieves malicious client security based on circuit-private FHE, and client privacy from the semantic security of the FHE scheme. We further explore a heuristic approach to extend our scheme to support verifiability, based on the difficulty of computing cheating circuits in low depth. This would yield a verifiable (P)OPRF. We provide a proof-of-concept implementation and preliminary benchmarks of our construction. For the core online OPRF functionality, we require amortised 10.0KB communication per evaluation and a one-time per-client setup communication of 2.5MB.

<div> 关键词：Byzantine agreement, Resource-based model, Verifiable Delay Function (VDF), Adaptive corruption, Communication complexity.

总结:
 Byzantine协议在分布式系统中至关重要，尤其在区块链中。本文关注资源受限模型，其中参与者使用如计算（VDF）或金钱作为资源。首先，我们实现了期望常数轮次的BA协议，支持适应性攻击、诚实多数且无需公钥基础设施，这是先前工作的突破。其次，给出了首个限制计算资源模型下BA通信复杂性的下限，证明即使有VDF访问，多播复杂度至少为$\sqrt{n}$。这些结果揭示了在资源受限环境下BA协议设计的复杂性和挑战。 <div>
Byzantine agreement (BA) is a fundamental primitive in distributed systems and has received huge interest as an important building block for blockchain systems. Classical byzantine agreement considers a setting where $n$ parties with fixed, known identities want to agree on an output in the presence of an adversary. Motivated by blockchain systems, the assumption of fixed identities is weakened by using a \emph{resource-based model}. In such models, parties do not have fixed known identities but instead have to invest some expensive resources to participate in the protocol. Prominent examples for such resources are computation (measured by, e.g., proofs-of-work) or money (measured by proofs-of-stake). Unlike in the classical setting where BA without trusted setup (e.g., a PKI or an unpredictable beacon) is impossible for $t \geq n/3$ corruptions, in such resource-based models, BA can be constructed for the optimal threshold of $t <n/2$. In this work, we investigate BA without a PKI in the model where parties have restricted computational resources. Concretely, we consider sequential computation modeled via computing a verifiable delay function (VDF) and establish the following results:

Positive Result: We present the first protocol for BA with expected constant round complexity and termination under adaptive corruption, honest majority and without a PKI. Earlier work achieved round complexity $O(n\kappa^2)$ (CRYPTO'15) or $O(\kappa)$ (PKC'18), where $\kappa$ is the security parameter.

Negative Result: We give the first lower bound on the communication complexity of BA in a model where parties have restricted computational resources. Concretely, we show that a multicast complexity of $O(\sqrt{n})$ is necessary even if the parties have access to a VDF oracle.

<div> 关键词：fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), k-means clustering, one-hot vector, minimum evaluation, bootstrapping

总结:<br />
文章提出了一种新的基于FHE的k-means聚类方法，旨在克服现有FHE聚类方案的高计算开销问题。该方法通过利用FHE的单指令多数据(SIMD)特性，设计了一个高效的加密环境下最小值评估算法，结合FHE的bootstrap技术，实现了单轮交互的FHE k-means，能够在一次迭代中完成整个加密数据聚类过程。实验表明，新方法在多种公开数据集上性能优于现有方案，且保持与明文结果相当的准确性。此外，还扩展了协议以支持大规模数据的mini-batch k-means，展示了其在大型数据集上的性能。 <div>
Clustering is a crucial unsupervised learning method extensively used in the field of data analysis. For analyzing big data, outsourced computation is an effective solution but privacy concerns arise when involving sensitive information. Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) enables computations on encrypted data, making it ideal for such scenarios. However, existing privacy-preserving clustering based on FHE are often constrained by the high computational overhead incurred from FHE, typically requiring decryption and interactions after only one iteration of the clustering algorithm. In this work, we propose a more efficient approach to evaluate the one-hot vector for the index of the minimum in an array with FHE, which fully exploits the parallelism of single-instruction-multiple-data of FHE schemes. By combining this with FHE bootstrapping, we present a practical FHE-based k-means clustering protocol whose required round of interactions between the data owner and the server is optimal, i.e., accomplishing the entire clustering process on encrypted data in a single round. We implement this protocol using the CKKS FHE scheme. Experiments show that our protocol significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art FHE-based k-means clustering protocols on various public datasets and achieves comparable accuracy to plaintext result. Additionally, We adapt our protocol to support mini-batch k-means for large-scale datasets and report its performance.

<div> 关键词：strike-lists、anonymous tickets functionality、secure protocol、server storage、anonymous outsourced state-keeping functionality

总结: <br />
这篇文章主要探讨了如何通过改进strike-lists技术来降低服务器存储需求。匿名门票功能(anonymous tickets functionality)旨在实现存储需求从$N \cdot t$降至$N \log(t)$，通过构建基于标准假设的加密协议，每个客户端的存储需求仅为$O(N)$个长度为$O(\log(t))$的消息的密文。此外，文章还扩展了strike-lists，考虑了匿名外包状态保持功能，防止恶意客户回滚状态，同时保护诚实客户的匿名性和机密性。关键在于提出了一种新方法，对抗服务器的有针对性攻击，确保恶意行为不会阻止诚实用户兑换票证或提供逃逸机制，使得服务器无法区分真实操作。 <div>
Strike-lists are a common technique for rollback and replay prevention in protocols that require that clients remain anonymous or that their current position in a state machine remain confidential. Strike-lists are heavily used in anonymous credentials, e-cash schemes, and trusted execution environments, and are widely deployed on the web in the form of Privacy Pass (PoPETS '18) and Google Private State Tokens.
In such protocols, clients submit pseudorandom tokens associated with each action (e.g.,  a page view in Privacy Pass) or state transition, and the token is added to a server-side list to prevent reuse. 

Unfortunately, the size of a strike-list, and hence the storage required by the server, is proportional to the total number of issued tokens, $N \cdot t$, where $N$ is the number of clients and $t$ is the maximum number of tickets per client. In this work, we ask whether it is possible to realize a strike-list-like functionality, which we call the anonymous tickets functionality, with storage requirements proportional to $N \log(t)$.

For the anonymous tickets functionality we construct a secure protocol from standard assumptions that achieves server storage of $O(N)$ ciphertexts, where each ciphertext encrypts a message of length $O(\log(t))$. We also consider an extension of the strike-list functionality where the server stores an arbitrary state for each client and clients advance their state with some function $s_i\gets f(s_{i-1},\mathsf{auxinput})$, which we call the anonymous outsourced state-keeping functionality. In this setting, malicious clients are prevented from rolling back their state, while honest clients are guaranteed anonymity and confidentiality against a malicious server. We achieve analogous results in this setting for two different classes of functions.

Our results rely on a new technique to preserve client anonymity in the face of selective failure attacks by a malicious server. Specifically, our protocol guarantees that misbehavior of the server either (1) does not prevent the honest client from redeeming a ticket or (2) provides the honest client with an escape hatch that can be used to simulate a redeem in a way that is indistinguishable to the server.

总结: <br />
本文主要关注区块链系统中支付渠道的监管问题。文章提出了一种创新方法，旨在为信任层2协议提供一种轻量级、可扩展且安全的审计解决方案，以满足反洗钱(AML)监管需求。该方案确保每个状态通道都能针对预定义的政策查询进行可验证审计，不会泄露额外信息，同时保持加密操作成本低、设置简单和存储复杂度与交易图无关。研究构建了一个基于Hydra Isomorphic State Channels (FC'21)的实际协议，将状态通道关联到真实世界的标识符，包括去中心化标识符和可验证的法律实体标识(vLEI)，这在金融服务业和监管机构中越来越受欢迎。这一工作有助于提升对离链支付通道的透明度和可控性。 <div>
Payment channels are one of the most prominent off-chain scaling solutions for blockchain systems. However, regulatory institutions have difficulty embracing them, as the channels lack insights needed for Anti-Money Laundering (AML) auditing purposes. Our work tackles the problem of a formal reliable and controllable inspection of off-ledger payment channels, by offering a novel approach for maintaining and reliably auditing statistics of payment channels. We extend a typical trustless Layer 2 protocol and provide a lightweight and scalable protocol such that:
        - every state channel is provably auditable w.r.t. a configurable set of policy queries, such that a regulator can retrieve reliable insights about the channel;
        - no information beyond the answers to auditing queries is leaked;
        - the cryptographic operations are inexpensive, the setup is simple, and storage complexity is independent of the transaction graph's size.
    We present a concrete protocol, based on Hydra Isomorphic State Channels (FC'21), and tie the creation of a state channel to real-world identifiers, both in a plain and privacy-preserving manner. For this, we employ verifiable credentials for decentralized identifiers, specifically verifiable Legal Entity Identifiers (vLEI) that increasingly gain traction for financial service providers and regulated institutions.

<title>A New PPML Paradigm for Quantized Models</title>

<div> 关键词：quantization, privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML), lookup tables, quantized operators, online performance

总结:
这篇文章主要探讨了如何在隐私保护机器学习(PPML)中有效利用量化模型。作者提出了一种新的PPML方法，特别针对量化模型设计，通过简化量化操作中的复杂内部结构，将模型推理视为一系列由查找表实现的量化运算。他们开发了一种高效的私有查找表评估协议，具有极低的在线通信成本，仅需$\log n$，其中$n$为查找表的大小。在单个CPU核心上，该协议能快速处理大量表格。基于此框架，量化模型的PPML实现了显著的速度提升，对于CNN（如AlexNet、VGG16和ResNet18）和大型语言模型（如GPT-2、GPT-Neo和Llama2）的在线性能分别提高了40-60倍和10-25倍。 <div>
Model quantization has become a common practice in machine learning (ML) to improve efficiency and reduce computational/communicational overhead. However, adopting quantization in privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) remains challenging due to the complex internal structure of quantized operators, which leads to inefficient protocols under the existing PPML frameworks. 

In this work, we propose a new PPML paradigm that is tailor-made for and can benefit from quantized models. Our main observation is that lookup tables can ignore the complex internal constructs of any functions which can be used to simplify the quantized operator evaluation. We view the model inference process as a sequence of quantized operators, and each operator is implemented by a lookup table. We then develop an efficient private lookup table evaluation protocol, and its online communication cost is only $\log n$, where $n$ is the size of the lookup table.  
On a single CPU core, our protocol can evaluate $2^{15}$ tables with 8-bit input and 8-bit output per second.

The resulting PPML framework for quantized models offers extremely fast online performance.
 The experimental results demonstrate that our quantization strategy achieves substantial speedups over SOTA PPML solutions, improving the online performance by $40\sim 60 \times$ w.r.t. convolutional neural network (CNN) models, such as AlexNet, VGG16, and ResNet18, and by $10\sim 25 \times$ w.r.t. large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-2, GPT-Neo, and Llama2.

<div> 关键词：Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), Privacy Conflict, Banks, Financial Institutions, User.

总结:
这篇文章主要探讨了中央银行数字货币（CBDC）的发展趋势，尤其是关注其对传统货币的改进以及面临的隐私挑战。研究者指出，尽管许多研究关注用户与监管机构之间的隐私权平衡，但忽视了银行和金融机构与用户之间的隐私问题。KAIME作为一种解决方案，旨在解决这一矛盾，同时保护用户的隐私。KAIME采用模块化设计，允许发送者和接收者的隐私得以隐藏，且其安全性基于简单且成熟的加密方法，这使得其在实施上比类似研究更为简便。因此，KAIME为CBDC系统中的隐私保护提供了一个全面的视角。 <div>
Recently, with the increasing interest in Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), many countries have been working on researching and developing digital currency. The most important reasons for this interest are that CBDC eliminates the disadvantages of traditional currencies and provides a safer, faster, and more efficient payment system. These benefits also come with challenges, such as safeguarding individuals’ privacy and ensuring regulatory mechanisms. While most researches address the privacy conflict between users and regulatory agencies, they miss an important detail. Important parts of a financial system are banks and financial institutions. Some studies ignore the need for privacy and include these institutions in the CBDC system, no system currently offers a solution to the privacy conflict between banks, financial institutions, and users. In this study, while we offer a solution to the privacy conflict between the user and the regulatory agencies, we also provide a solution to the privacy conflict between the user and the banks. Our solution, KAIME  has also a modular structure. The privacy of the sender and receiver can be hidden if desired. Compared to previous related research, security analysis and implementation of KAIME is substantially simpler because simple and well-known cryptographic methods are used.

<title>Distributed Verifiable Random Function With Compact Proof</title>

<div> 关键词：Verifiable Random Functions (VRFs), Distributed VRFs (DVRFs), DVRFwCP, constant-size proofs, efficient verification.

总结:<br />
本文提出了一种新型的分布式可验证随机函数系统(DVRFwCP)，它在解决现有DVRFs的问题上取得了显著进步。DVRFwCP的特点在于其拥有常数大小的证明，这意味着证明的大小不会随着参与者数量增加而变化，这相较于早期系统是一个重大改进。此外，DVRFwCP通过移除对计算密集型的双线性配对的需求，实现了更高效的验证过程。与DDH-DVRF和GLOW-DVRF等知名实现相比，DVRFwCP在安全性与可扩展性方面具有明显优势，尤其是在估计的燃气成本上。这一创新为去中心化环境中生成可验证随机数提供了更为可靠和高效的解决方案。 <div>
Verifiable Random Functions (VRFs) are cryptographic primitives that generate unpredictable randomness along with proofs that are verifiable, a critical requirement for blockchain applications in decentralized finance, online gaming, and more. Existing VRF constructions often rely on centralized entities, creating security vulnerabilities. Distributed VRFs (DVRFs) offer a decentralized alternative but face challenges like large proof sizes or dependence on computationally expensive bilinear pairings. 
In this research, a unique distributed VRF (DVRF) system called DVRFwCP with considerable improvements is proposed. DVRFwCP has constant-size proofs, which means that the size of the proof does not change based on the number of participants. This overcomes a significant drawback of earlier DVRF systems, which saw proof size increase with participant count. Furthermore, DVRFwCP produces more efficient verification than previous systems by eliminating the requirement for bilinear pairings throughout the verification process. These innovations contribute to a more secure and scalable solution for generating verifiable randomness in decentralized environments.
We compare our construction to well-established DVRF instantiations such as DDH-DVRF and GLOW-DVRF while also pointing out the major improvement in the estimated gas cost of these algorithms.

<title>Cryptiny: Compacting Cryptography for Space-Restricted Channels and its Use-case for IoT-E2EE</title>

<div> 关键词：cryptiny、IoT、security goals、CCA-secrecy、SDHIES

总结:<br />
Cryptiny是一种新型加密范式，它使用单一加密值实现多重安全目标，适用于带宽受限的物联网环境。文章以BLE广播信标与远程配对的主人之间的实时通信为例，该场景中，信标通过BLE-IP网关设备和云服务器发送信息。要求保障高安全性和隐私性，如双向安全和观察者的前向后向安全性。为了实现这些，文章提出了一种名为SDHIES的新加密方案，其特点是使用公钥的函数进行加密，而非直接使用公钥。通过cryptiny，作者证明了协议能提供信标和观察者消息的CCA保密性，以及观察者的双向安全和双方的互私性。 <div>
We present a novel cryptographic paradigm denoted  ``cryptiny:'' Employing a single cryptographic value for several security goals, thus ``compacting'' the communication sent over a space-restricted (narrow) channel, while still proving security. Cryptiny is contrary to the classical cryptographic convention of using a separate cryptographic element for each security goal. 

Demonstrating  the importance of cryptiny, we employ it for securing a critical IoT configuration in which a broadcasting ``thing'' (called beacon) operates within stringent bandwidth constraints. In this setting, a compact BLE-broadcasting beacon lacking Internet connectivity efficiently directs brief (non fragmented) messages to its remotely pre-paired owner in real-time. Communication transpires through BLE-to-IP gateway devices denoted observers, (typically smartphones in the beacon's vicinity), and subsequently via a cloud app server. The gateway device as well, piggybacks on the transmission a secure and private message to the owner. This configuration is a generic setting for the current and future IoT real-time ecosystems, where billion of owners, beacons, and observers operate. 

The configuration instances (analogous to TLS instances over the Internet) imposes high security and privacy demands. We prove that our cryptiny-based protocol for securing the above configuration achieves CCA-secrecy for the beacon's and the observer's messages with backward and forward security for the observer's message, as well simultaneously achieving  mutual privacy for beacons and for observers. Achieving backward and forward security is important since beacon devices may be far from their owners for a long duration and may be passively tampered with. In addition, for the backward security proof we develop a new encryption scheme we call ``shifted-DHIES'' (``SDHIES'' for short), which generalizes DHIES. An interesting feature of SDHIES is that encryption is performed with a function of the public key rather than the public key itself.

<div> 关键词：transformers, secure multiparty computation (MPC), CrypTen, non-linear functions, discrete wavelet transformations

总结:
Curl是一个新的安全多方计算（MPC）框架，专注于提升非线性函数的处理效率。它通过使用离散小波变换来减小查找表大小，从而减少 rounds 和通信量，相比于CrypTen有高达19倍的改进。Curl提供了类似于CrypTen的编程模型和并行化能力，适用于大型语言模型（LLMs），如BERT、GPT-2和GPT Neo。此外，文章还解决了关于常用概率截断协议安全性的争议，证明其在独立模型中的安全性，这对依赖这类技术的其他研究具有重要意义。总的来说，Curl通过优化和增强MPC在处理复杂机器学习任务中的隐私保护性能，推动了该领域的进步。 <div>
Recent advancements in transformers have revolutionized machine learning, forming the core of Large language models (LLMs). However, integrating these systems into everyday applications raises privacy concerns as client queries are exposed to model owners. Secure multiparty computation (MPC) allows parties to evaluate machine learning applications while keeping sensitive user inputs and proprietary models private. Due to inherent MPC costs, recent works introduce model-specific optimizations that hinder widespread adoption by machine learning researchers. CrypTen (NeurIPS'21) aimed to solve this problem by exposing MPC primitives via common machine learning abstractions such as tensors and modular neural networks. Unfortunately, CrypTen and many other MPC frameworks rely on polynomial approximations of the non-linear functions, resulting in high errors and communication complexity.

This paper introduces Curl, an easy-to-use MPC framework that evaluates non-linear functions as lookup tables, resulting in better approximations and significant round and communication reduction. Curl exposes a similar programming model as CrypTen and is highly parallelizable through tensors. At its core, Curl relies on discrete wavelet transformations to reduce the lookup table size without sacrificing accuracy, which results in up to $19\times$ round and communication reduction compared to CrypTen for non-linear functions such as logarithms and reciprocals. We evaluate Curl on a diverse set of LLMs, including BERT, GPT-2, and GPT Neo, and compare against state-of-the-art related works such as Iron (NeurIPS'22) and Bolt (S&amp;P'24) achieving at least $1.9\times$ less communication and latency.

Finally, we resolve a long-standing debate regarding the security of widely used probabilistic truncation protocols by proving their security in the stand-alone model. This is of independent interest as many related works rely on this truncation style.

<div> 关键词：Single Sign-On (SSO), Pseudonym, Identity Provider (IdP), Relying Parties (RPs), Security.

总结:<br />文章探讨了现有的单点登录（SSO）系统中用户隐私问题，尤其是当IdP知道用户访问哪个RP时。为了解决这一问题，作者提出了一种新的、无观察、强安全且便利的SSO系统，允许IdP在不暴露RP身份的情况下生成对RP特定的伪匿名标识。该模型强调了RP的身份验证需求，即IdP需要验证令牌和伪匿名是否发给注册的RP。作者构建了一个结合签名、知识证明和盲但可验证的哈希版Diffie-Hellman PRF的方案，并证明其安全性。实验表明，该方案在运行时间上高效，每方耗时2-20ms。 <div>
Single Sign-On (SSO) allows users to conveniently authenticate to many Relying Parties (RPs) through a central Identity Provider (IdP). SSO supports unlinkable authentication towards the RPs via pairwise pseudonyms, where the IdP assigns the user an RP-specific pseudonym. This feature has been rolled out prominently within Apple's SSO service. While establishing unlinkable identities provides privacy towards RPs, it actually emphasizes the main privacy problem of SSO: with every authentication request, the IdP learns the RP that the user wants to access. Solutions to overcome this limitation exist, but either assume users to behave honestly or require them to manage long-term cryptographic keys.

In this work, we propose the first SSO system that can provide such pseudonymous authentication in an unobservable yet strongly secure and convenient manner. That is, the IdP blindly derives the user's pairwise pseudonym for the targeted RP without learning the RP's identity and without requiring key material handled by the user. We formally define the desired security and privacy properties for such unlinkable, unobservable, and strongly secure SSO. In particular, our model includes the often neglected RP authentication: the IdP typically wants to limit its services to registered RPs only and thus must be able to (blindly) verify that it issues the token and pseudonym to such a registered RP. We propose a simple construction that combines signatures with efficient proofs-of-knowledge with a blind, yet verifiable, evaluation of the Hashed-Diffie-Hellman PRF. We prove the security of our construction and demonstrate its efficiency through a prototypical implementation, which requires a running time of 2-20ms per involved party.

PARScoin是一种新型的隐私保护、可审计和符合监管要求的稳定币设计，旨在解决传统稳定币在隐私、费用和可扩展性方面的问题。它通过智能合约实现，具有高性能和可扩展性，适用于大规模用户场景。PARScoin的设计是区块链无关的，采用通用组合(UC)框架进行分析，为无缝融入现有区块链生态系统提供了一种安全且模块化的方法。这种创新设计旨在提升稳定币的使用体验和信任度，同时保持高效运作。 <div>
Stablecoins are digital assets designed to maintain a consistent value relative to a reference point, serving as a vital component in Blockchain, and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Typical implementations of stablecoins via smart contracts come with important downsides such as a questionable level of privacy, potentially high fees, and lack of scalability.

总结:<br />
本文提出了一种新的两党 Dilithium 签名方案变体，专注于用户身份验证。该设计基于 Dilithium 签名的压缩技术，沿用了 Damgård 等人（PKC 2021）中使用的加法同态承诺方案，但更接近 NIST PQC 竞赛提交的版本。新方案的安全性建立在模块化 LWE 和 SIS 问题的困难性之上，展示了对现有量子攻击防御的考虑。 <div>
In previous years there has been an increased interest in designing threshold signature schemes. Most of the recent works focus on constructing threshold versions of ECDSA or Schnorr signature schemes due to their appealing usage in blockchain technologies. Additionally, a lot of research is being done on cryptographic schemes that are resistant to quantum computer attacks.
In this work, we propose a new version of the two-party Dilithium signature scheme. The security of our scheme is based on the hardness of Module-LWE and Module-SIS problems. In our construction, we follow a similar logic as Damgård et al. (PKC 2021) and use an additively homomorphic commitment scheme. However, compared to them, our protocol uses signature compression techniques from the original Dilithium signature scheme which makes it closer to the version submitted to the NIST PQC competition. We focus on two-party signature schemes in the context of user authentication.

<title>DeCAF: Decentralizable Continuous Group Key Agreement with Fast Healing</title>
<link>https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/559</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> 关键词：Continuous Group Key Agreement (CGKA), TreeKEM, Concurrent CGKA, CoCoA, DeCAF.

总结:
本文主要关注连续群密钥协议（Continuous Group Key Agreement, CGKA）的并发解决方案。文章提到现有的TreeKEM（RFC 9420）在处理并发请求时存在局限，而CoCoA虽然并发且通信复杂度低，但用户更新可能需要多次请求。为解决这些问题，作者提出了DeCAF（Decentralized Concurrency-Aware Fast Healing），一种适用于中心服务器和去中心化设置的高效协议。

DeCAF特别适合去中心化的组消息系统，如区块链环境，它能在最多$\log(t)$轮请求内修复被攻击情况，相比CoCoA的$\log(n)$轮更快速。尽管在中心服务器场景中，CoCoA在下载通信方面更优，但在去中心化情况下，DeCAF在修复速度和每轮用户通信成本上具有显著优势。 <div>
Continuous group key agreement (CGKA) allows a group of users to maintain a continuously updated shared key in an asynchronous setting where parties only come online sporadically and their messages are relayed by an untrusted server. CGKA captures the basic primitive underlying group messaging schemes.

Current solutions including TreeKEM ("Messaging Layer Security'' (MLS) IETF RFC 9420) cannot handle concurrent requests while retaining low communication complexity. The exception being CoCoA, which is concurrent while having extremely low communication complexity (in groups of size $n$ and for $m$ concurrent updates the communication per user is $\log(n)$, i.e., independent of $m$). The main downside of CoCoA is that in groups of size $n$, users might have to do up to $\log(n)$ update requests to the server to ensure their (potentially corrupted) key material has been refreshed.

In this work we present a "fast healing'' concurrent CGKA protocol, named DeCAF, where users will heal after at most $\log(t)$ requests, with $t$ being the number of corrupted users. While also suitable for the standard central-server setting, our protocol is particularly interesting for realizing decentralized group messaging, where protocol messages (add, remove, update) are being posted on some append-only data structure rather than sent to a server. In this setting, concurrency is crucial once the rate of requests exceeds, say, the rate at which new blocks are added to a blockchain.

In the central-server setting, CoCoA (the only alternative with  concurrency, sub-linear communication and basic post-compromise security)  enjoys much lower download communication. However, in the decentralized setting - where there is no server which can craft specific messages for different users to reduce their download communication - our protocol  significantly outperforms CoCoA. DeCAF heals in fewer rounds ($\log(t)$ vs. $\log(n)$) while incurring a similar per round per user communication cost.

<div> 关键词：password-authenticated, deterministic wallets (PADW), shared-custodial wallets, privacy, security

总结: <br />
密码验证确定性钱包(PADW)是一种创新的共享托管钱包解决方案，它在用户和服务器之间共享用户的秘密密钥，提供强大的安全和隐私保障。用户通过密码验证后与服务器进行交互式签名协议。PADW的安全性基于至少一方被攻击的前提下，保证交易安全。隐私方面，即使服务器被攻破，也无法将交易与特定用户关联。我们给出了一个盲Schnorr签名的实现，支持确定性密钥生成，且不依赖复杂加密技术。该方案在随机Oracle模型下对适应性攻击证明了安全性，仅依赖Schnorr签名不可伪造性和公钥加密的CCA安全。 <div>
Cryptographic wallets are an essential tool in Blockchain networks to ensure the secure storage and maintenance of an user's cryptographic keys. Broadly, wallets can be divided into three categories, namely custodial, non-custodial, and shared-custodial wallets. The first two are centralized solutions, i.e., the wallet is operated by a single entity, which inherently introduces a single point of failure. Shared-custodial wallets, on the other hand, are maintained by two independent parties, e.g., the wallet user and a service provider, and hence avoid the single point of failure centralized solutions. Unfortunately, current shared-custodial wallets suffer from significant privacy issues.

In our work, we introduce password-authenticated deterministic wallets (PADW), a novel and efficient shared-custodial wallet solution, which exhibits strong security and privacy guarantees. In a nutshell, in a PADW scheme, the secret key of the user is shared between the user and the server. In order to generate a signature, the user first authenticates itself to the server by providing a password and afterwards engages in an interactive signing protocol with the server. Security is guaranteed as long as at most one of the two parties is corrupted. Privacy, on the other hand, guarantees that a corrupted server cannot link a transaction to a particular user. We formally model the notion of PADW schemes and we give an instantiation from blind Schnorr signatures. Our construction allows for deterministic key derivation, a feature that is widely used in practice by existing wallet schemes, and it does not rely on any heavy cryptographic primitives. We prove our scheme secure against adaptive adversaries in the random oracle model and under standard assumptions. That is, our security proof only relies on the assumption that the Schnorr signature scheme is unforgeable and that a public key encryption scheme is CCA-secure.

这篇文章主要探讨了通过部署在私有和公共区块链上的智能合约来存储线性事件的实验。研究关注了三个关键指标：部署智能合约的成本（初期的以太坊“gas”单位），存储单个或多个客户端事件的时间和gas费用。实验涵盖了多种公共区块链，如Hedera、Fantom、Harmony Shard0等，以及Polygon Amoy、Ethereum Sepolia、Optimism Sepolia、Klaytn Baobab和Arbitrum Sepolia。同时，文章还分析了Hyperledger Besu使用不同共识算法作为私有链的性能。这些发现有助于评估不同区块链平台在存储效率和成本方面的优劣。 <div>
This paper reports the experimental results related to lineage event storage via smart contracts deployed on private and public blockchain. In our experiments we measure the following three metrics: the cost to deploy the storage smart contract on the blockchain, which measures the initial expenditure, typically in gas units, required to deploy the smart contract that facilitates lineage event storage, then the time and gas costs needed to store a lineage event. We investigated both single and multi-clients scenarios. We considered the following public blockchains: Hedera, Fantom, Harmony Shard0, Polygon Amoy, Ethereum Sepolia, Optimism Sepolia, Klaytn Baobab and Arbitrum Sepolia. Furthermore, we investigate the performances of Hyperledger Besu with different consensus algorithms as private blockchains.

<div> 关键词：Online ride-sharing services, Privacy concerns, Oblivious matching, Secure multi-party computation, Performance.

总结:<br />本文提出了一种名为QuickPool的在线拼车服务解决方案，以解决环境和交通问题，同时保护用户隐私。QuickPool允许乘客和司机通过加密的方式向服务提供商（SP）提交行程信息，仅涉及部分路线重叠和起点终点位置的区城性模糊匹配，无需第三方服务器。该方案在半诚实设置下使用安全多方计算技术，提供了协议安全证明并进行了性能测试，与现有工作的比较显示了1.6-2倍的速度提升。QuickPool有效地提高了拼车服务的效率和用户隐私保护。 <div>
Online ride-sharing services (RSS) have become very popular owing to increased awareness of environmental concerns and as a response to increased traffic congestion. To request a ride, users submit their locations and route information for ride matching to a service provider (SP), leading to possible privacy concerns caused by leakage of users' location data. We propose QuickPool, an efficient SP-aided RSS solution that can obliviously match multiple riders and drivers simultaneously, without involving any other auxiliary server. End-users, namely, riders and drivers share their route information with SP as encryptions of the ordered set of points-of-interest (PoI) of their route from their start to end locations. SP performs a zone based oblivious matching of drivers and riders, based on partial route overlap as well as proximity of start and end points. QuickPool is in the semi-honest setting, and makes use of secure multi-party computation. We provide security proof of our protocol, perform extensive testing of our implementation and show that our protocol simultaneously matches multiple drivers and riders very efficiently. We compare the performance of QuickPool with state-of-the-art works and observe a speed up of 1.6 - 2$\times$.

<div> 关键词：secret key, additive somewhat homomorphic, perfect privacy, server inputs, malicious model.

总结: <br />该研究关注的是秘密关键的加法稍微同态方案，其中客户端拥有完美隐私，即使服务器是计算无界的。文章介绍了一种处理电路乘法的方法，通过将乘法运算交给客户端执行并加密返回结果。另一个特点是2-party协议可以处理包含服务器输入的情况，但服务器隐私依赖于子集和问题的难度，而非信息理论。此外，协议设计允许通过为较小子电路使用独立的加密参数来扩展2PC，保持密文大小在电路增大时不变。在恶意模型中，服务器的正确性可以通过第三方高概率验证，同时保护客户端和服务器的隐私不被验证者获取。 <div>
Two-party computation has been an active area of research since Yao's breakthrough results on garbled circuits. We present secret key additive somewhat homomorphic schemes where the client has perfect privacy (server can be computationally unbounded). Our basic scheme is additive somewhat homomorphic and we give protocols to handle addition and multiplication. In one scheme, the server handles circuit multiplication gates by returning the multiplicands to the client which does the multiplication and sends back the encrypted product. We give a 2-party protocol that 
also incorporates server inputs where the client has perfect privacy. Server privacy is not information-theoretic, but rather depends on hardness of the subset sum problem.
Correctness for the server in the malicious model can be verified by a 3rd party with high probability where the client and server privacy are information-theoretically protected from the verifier. Scaling the 2PC protocol via separate encryption parameters for smaller subcircuits allows the ciphertext size to remain constant as circuit size grows.

<div> 关键词：Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, High-Dimensional Data, Homomorphic Encryption, Dimensionality Reduction.

总结:<br />
这篇文章关注的是在人工智能和大数据时代，如何处理高维度数据的安全存储和高效分析。为了解决这一问题，研究者提出了一种基于CKKS的新型同态加密降维方案（HE-DR）。HE-DR通过修改Rank-Revealing方法使其适应全同态加密，实现了无需传输原始用户数据的加密数据降维，显著提高了安全性和效率。相比于传统方法，HE-DR在计算效率上提升约60-200倍，通信开销减小至1/3。实验显示，即使处理高维度数据，HE-DR的性能依然稳定，计算效率与数据维度的关系趋于平缓，而计算误差保持在极低水平。总的来说，该方案为多方参与的高维数据保护和分析提供了一个有效的解决方案。 <div>
The proliferation of artificial intelligence and big data has resulted in a surge in data demand and increased data dimensionality. This escalation has consequently heightened the costs associated with storage and processing. Concurrently, the confidential nature of data collected by various institutions, which cannot be disclosed due to personal privacy concerns, has exacerbated the challenges associated with data analysis and machine learning model training. Therefore, designing a secure and efficient high-dimensional data reduction method that supports multi-party joint participation becomes critical to solving these problems.

This paper proposes a novel homomorphic encryption dimensionality reduction scheme (HE-DR) based on CKKS, which modifies the Rank-Revealing (RR) method to make it more applicable to fully homomorphic encryption, thereby achieving fast and secure dimension reduction for high-dimensional data. Compared to traditional homomorphic encryption dimensionality reduction schemes, our approach does not transmit the user’s original data to other participants in any format (Ciphertext or Plaintext). Moreover, our method's computational efficiency is nearly $60-200$ times faster than similar algorithms, and the communication overhead is only $1/3$ of theirs. Finally, we have shown that our proposed scheme can preserve its computational efficiency and accuracy even when dealing with high-dimensional data. As dimensionality escalates, the ratio of ciphertext to plaintext computational efficiency plateaus at approximately 5 times, while the computational error (distance between subspaces) remains around $1e^{-11}$

<div> 关键词：ZK-SNARKs, Merkle树, Arithmetization-Oriented, PGV模式, Hades blockcipher

总结:<br />
本文探讨了基于AO（Arithmetization-Oriented）的ZK-SNARKs中，使用PGV模式构建高效的FIL（固定输入长度）压缩函数的方法。作者提出了PGV-LC和PGV-ELC两种模式，继承并扩展了经典的Preneel-Govaerts-Vandewalle（PGV）框架，保证了在理想密码模型下的碰撞和预映射抵抗，以及对Merkle树的开放抵抗。通过与流行的Poseidon和其改进版Poseidon2比较，新设计在性能上有所提升，特别是在Groth16 SNARK框架中更快。此外，文章还研究了使用高阶Merkle树的优势，优化了Hades blockcipher与PGV-ELC的组合，显著减少了Merkle树构造和证明生成时间。 <div>
ZK-SNARKs, a fundamental component of privacy-oriented payment systems, identity protocols, or anonymous voting systems, are advanced cryptographic protocols for verifiable computation: modern SNARKs allow to encode the invariants of a program, expressed as an arithmetic circuit, in an appropriate constraint language from which short, zero-knowledge proofs for correct computations can be constructed.

  One of the most important computations that is run through SNARK systems is the verification of Merkle tree (MT) opening proofs, which relies on the evaluation of a fixed-input-length (FIL) cryptographic compression function over binary MTs. 
  As classical, bit-oriented hash functions like SHA-2 are not compactly representable in SNARK frameworks, Arithmetization-Oriented (AO) cryptographic designs have emerged as an alternative, efficient solution.
  
  Today, the majority of AO compression functions are built from the Sponge permutation-based hashing mode. 
  While this approach allows cost savings, compared to blockcipher-based modes, as it does not require key-scheduling, AO blockcipher schedulers are often cheap to compute. 
  Furthermore, classical bit-oriented cryptography has long studied how to construct provably secure compression functions from blockciphers, following the Preneel-Govaerts-Vandewalle (PGV) framework. 
  The potential efficiency gains together with the strong provable security foundations in the classic setting, motivate the study of AO blockcipher-based compression functions.
  
  In this work, we propose PGV-LC and PGV-ELC, two AO blockcipher-based FIL compression modes inspired by and extending the classical PGV approach, offering flexible input and output sizes and coming with provable security guarantees in the AO setting. 
  We prove the collision and preimage resistance in the ideal cipher model, and give bounds for collision and opening resistance over MTs of arbitrary arity.
  
  We compare experimentally the AO PGV-ELC mode over the Hades blockcipher with its popular and widely adopted Sponge instantiation, Poseidon, and its improved variant Poseidon2. 
  Our resulting constructions are up to \(3\times \) faster than Poseidon and \(2\times \) faster than Poseidon2 in native x86 execution, and up to \(50\% \) faster in the Groth16 SNARK framework. 
  
  Finally, we study the benefits of using MTs of arity wider than two, proposing a new strategy to obtain a compact R1CS constraint system in such case.
  In fact, by combining an efficient parametrization of the Hades blockcipher over the PGV-ELC mode, together with an optimal choice of the MT arity, we measured an improvement of up to \(9\times \) in native MT construction time, and up to \(2.5\times \) in proof generation time, compared to Poseidon over binary MTs.

<div> 关键词：Chameleon-hash functions, Trapdoor, Collision-resistance, Notions, Black-box construction.

总结:<br />
Chameleon-hash函数是一种由Krawczyk和Rabin在2000年NDSS会议上提出的特殊哈希函数，它依赖于公钥，私钥可导致碰撞。这些函数在密码学中有广泛应用，如提升非适应性安全签名到适应性安全。文章探讨了不同的碰撞抵抗概念，指出在某些复杂应用中，实际需求可能未被充分覆盖。研究者重新审视现有理论，分析它们之间的关系，并针对可编辑区块链等应用讨论不同抵抗性的实际影响。此外，他们提出了一种更强大、更理想的碰撞抵抗定义，并提供了一个简单高效的黑盒构造方法来实现这种强抵抗性。 <div>
Chameleon-hash functions, introduced by Krawczyk and Rabin at NDSS 2000, are trapdoor collision-resistant hash-functions parametrized by a public key. If the corresponding secret key is known, arbitrary collisions for the hash function can be efficiently found. Chameleon-hash functions have prominent applications in the design of cryptographic primitives, such as lifting non-adaptively secure signatures to adaptively secure ones. Recently, this primitive also received a lot of attention as a building block in more complex cryptographic applications ranging from editable blockchains to advanced signature and encryption schemes.

We observe that in latter applications various different notions of collision-resistance are used, and it is not always clear if the respective notion does really cover what seems intuitively required by the application. Therefore, we revisit existing collision-resistance notions in the literature, study their relations, and - using the example of the recent redactable blockchain proposals - discuss which practical impact different notions of collision-resistance might have. Moreover, we provide a stronger, and arguably more desirable, notion of collision-resistance than what is known from the literature. Finally, we present a surprisingly simple and efficient black-box construction of chameleon-hash functions achieving this strong notion.

<div> 关键词：Transformer模型、隐私保护、两党设置、矩阵乘法、非线性激活函数。

总结:<br />
该研究关注大型Transformer模型的隐私保护问题，特别是在两党设置下的私有推理。为此，作者提出BumbleBee，一个专注于速度和通信效率的系统。其贡献包括：<br />
1. 优化的矩阵乘法协议，比先前方法减少80%-90%的通信成本。
2. 针对Transformer模型中使用的非线性激活函数的高效协议，显著提升处理速度并降低80%-95%的通信开销。

4. 相比Iron (NeurIPS22)有超过一倍的速度优势，且比BOLT (Oakland24)快三倍，同时通信量少十分之一。 <div>
Abstract—Large transformer-based models have realized state- of-the-art performance on lots of real-world tasks such as natural language processing and computer vision. However, with the increasing sensitivity of the data and tasks they handle, privacy has become a major concern during model deployment. In this work, we focus on private inference in two-party settings, where one party holds private inputs and the other holds the model. We introduce BumbleBee, a fast and communication-friendly two- party private transformer inference system. Our contributions are three-fold: First, we propose optimized protocols for matrix multiplication, which significantly reduce communication costs by 80% – 90% compared to previous techniques. Secondly, we develop a methodology for constructing efficient protocols tailored to the non-linear activation functions employed in transformer models. The proposed activation protocols have realized a significant enhancement in processing speed, alongside a remarkable reduction in communication costs by 80% – 95% compared with two prior methods. Lastly, we have performed extensive benchmarks on five transformer models. BumbleBee demonstrates its capability by evaluating the LLaMA-7B model, generating one token in approximately 14 minutes using CPUs. Our results further reveal that BumbleBee outperforms Iron (NeurIPS22) by over an order of magnitude and is three times faster than BOLT (Oakland24) with one-tenth communication.

<div> 关键词：Blockchain consensus, 2-chain VABA, sMVBA, 2PAC, Super Fast Pipelined Blocks

总结:
本文介绍了一种新的区块链共识协议设计，包括2PAC（两阶段异步共识）和超级快速管道块。2PAC分为两个变体，2PAC$^\text{lean}$具有简洁链路和$9.5\delta$预期延迟，通过减少消息复杂度达到更高的吞吐量；而2PAC$^\text{BIG}$则是最快的异步协议，具有立方级消息复杂度，能在无消息乱序的情况下实现单次决策仅需$4\delta$。超级快速管道块改进了管道块的决策速度，即使在故障节点存在时也能保证低延迟，同时保持一致性。结合这些技术，如s2PAC$^\text{lean}$、s2PAC$^\text{BIG}$和sGradedDAG等协议分别实现了更快的决策时间。 <div>
Blockchain consensus, a.k.a. BFT SMR, are protocols enabling $n$ processes to decide on an ever-growing chain. The fastest known asynchronous one is called 2-chain VABA (PODC'21 and FC'22), and is used as fallback chain in Abraxas* (CCS'23). It has a claimed $9.5\delta$ expected latency when used for a single shot instance, a.k.a. an MVBA.
We exhibit attacks breaking it. Hence, the title of the fastest asynchronous MVBA with quadratic messages complexity goes to sMVBA (CCS'22), with $10\delta$ expected latency.
Our positive contributions are two new and complementary designs.

$\bullet$  2PAC (2-phase asynchronous consensus). It has a simpler and lighter chaining than in previous approaches. Instantiated with either quadratic or cubic phases of voting, it yields:

   2PAC$^\text{lean}$: $+90\%$ throughput and $9.5\delta$ expected latency, with quadratic ($O(n^2)$) messages complexity. In both 2-chain VABA and sMVBA (as if chained, with pipelining), the quorum-certified transactions which were produced in the worst-case 1/3 of views with a slow leader were dumped, so the work was lost. The simpler design of 2PAC inserts such blocks in straight-line in the chain.
Thus, contrary to naive uncle-referencing, this comes with no computational overhead, yielding a net $+50\%$ throughput gain over chained sMVBA. Both the remaining throughput and latency ($-0.5\delta$) gains, come from the lighter interactive construction of proofs of consistency appended to proposed blocks, compared to sMVBA.

   2PAC$^\text{BIG}$: the fastest asynchronous blockchain consensus with cubic ($O(n^3)$) messages complexity. Fault-free single shot MVBA runs decide in just $4\delta$, as soon as no message is delivered more than twice faster than others: GradedDAG (SRDS'23) required furthermore no messages reordering.

$\bullet$  Super Fast Pipelined Blocks. This is an upgrade of previous approaches for pipelining: in 2-chain VABA, Cordial Miners (DISC'23) and GradedDAG, a block pipelined by a leader in the middle of the view had almost twice larger latency than the non-pipelined block. Our design provides a fast path deciding the pipelined block with even smaller latency than the non-pipelined block. The fast delay is guaranteed in all executions with a fair scheduler, but remarkably, whatever the behaviors of faulty processes. Consistency is preserved by a lightweight mechanism, of one threshold signature appended per proposal.
Instantiated with the previous protocols, it yields: s2PAC$^\text{lean}$, with fast decision of pipelined blocks in $4\delta$; s2PAC$^\text{BIG}$, in $3\delta$; and sGradedDAG, in $3\delta$.

总结:<br />
本文探讨了在数据隐私日益重要的背景下，利用可完全同态加密（FHE）进行机器学习服务的潜在解决方案。研究者提出了使用多出口神经网络（MENNs）来加速FHE推理，以降低计算成本和时间。文章分析了FHE-MENN推理的延迟、通信、准确性和资源消耗，并介绍了名为TorMENNt的攻击，该攻击能利用用户提前终止计算来实施侧信道攻击，预测图像分类结果。文章还讨论了可能的防御措施及其有效性，并结合成本效益分析，为FHE-MENN的实际应用提供了一条实用路径。 <div>
With concerns about data privacy growing in a connected world, cryptography researchers have focused on fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) for promising machine learning as a service solutions. Recent advancements have lowered the computational cost by several orders of magnitude, but the latency of fully homomorphic neural networks remains a barrier to adoption. This work proposes using multi-exit neural networks (MENNs) to accelerate the FHE inference. MENNs are network architectures that provide several exit points along the depth of the network. This approach allows users to employ results from any exit and terminate the computation early, saving both time and power. First, this work weighs the latency, communication, accuracy, and computational resource benefits of running FHE-based MENN inference. Then, we present the TorMENNt attack that can exploit the user's early termination decision to launch a concrete side-channel on MENNs. We demonstrate that the TorMENNt attack can predict the private image classification output of an image set for both FHE and plaintext threat models. We discuss possible countermeasures to mitigate the attack and examine their effectiveness. Finally, we tie the privacy risks with a cost-benefit analysis to obtain a practical roadmap for FHE-based MENN adoption.

总结:<br />这篇文章主要探讨了Transformer模型广泛应用中信息泄露的问题。为了解决这一问题，作者提出了BOLT（Privacy-preserving Inference Framework for Transformer）框架，它专注于高效处理大规模模型的矩阵乘法和非线性计算。BOLT通过机器学习优化减少了10.91倍的通信成本。实验结果显示，BOLT在各种网络环境下比现有最先进的系统快4.8-9.5倍，同时保持与浮点模型相当的准确性。总的来说，BOLT是一个在保证隐私的同时提升Transformer模型推理效率的关键解决方案。 <div>
The advent of transformers has brought about significant advancements in traditional machine learning tasks. However, their pervasive deployment has raised concerns about the potential leakage of sensitive information during inference. Existing approaches using secure multiparty computation (MPC) face limitations when applied to transformers due to the extensive model size and resource-intensive matrix-matrix multiplications. In this paper, we present BOLT, a privacy-preserving inference framework for transformer models that supports efficient matrix multiplications and nonlinear computations. Combined with our novel machine learning optimizations, BOLT reduces the communication cost by 10.91x. Our evaluation on diverse datasets demonstrates that BOLT maintains comparable accuracy to floating-point models and achieves 4.8-9.5x faster inference across various network settings compared to the state-of-the-art system.

<div> 关键词：universal verifiability、electronic voting、everlasting privacy、linearly-homomorphic signatures、receipt-freeness。

总结:
本文探讨了如何利用线性同态签名在电子投票系统中实现普遍可验证性和永恒隐私。传统的做法涉及公开加密投票和证明，但牺牲了长期隐私。作者提出了一种新方法，通过结合完美隐藏承诺和线性同态签名，既能确保投票过程的公正性（即普遍可验证性），又能保证投票的绝对隐私（即永恒隐私），即使在结果公布和证明发布后也是如此。这种方法的证明有效性基于代数群模型和随机 oracle 模型。这种技术革新为电子投票系统提供了高效且兼顾隐私保护的解决方案。 <div>
Universal verifiability is a must-to-have for electronic voting schemes. It is essential to ensure honest behavior of all the players during the whole process, together with the eligibility. However, it should not endanger the privacy of the individual votes, which is another major requirement.
Whereas the first property prevents attacks during the voting process, privacy of the votes should hold forever, which has been called everlasting privacy.

A classical approach for universal verifiability is to add some proofs together with the encrypted votes, which requires publication of the latter, while eligibility needs a link between the votes and the voters: it definitely excludes long-term privacy. An alternative is the use of perfectly-hiding commitments, on which proofs are published, while ciphertexts are kept private for computing the tally.

In this paper, we show how recent linearly-homomorphic signatures can be exploited for all the proofs, leading to very efficient procedures towards universal verifiability with both strong receipt-freeness and everlasting privacy.
Privacy will indeed be unconditional, after the publication of the results and the proofs, whereas the soundness of the proofs holds in the algebraic group model and the random oracle model.

<div> 关键词：Distributed random beacon, HashRand, Post-Quantum security, Asynchronous SMR, Communication efficiency.

总结: <br />
HashRand是一种高效、异步的分布式随机信标协议，它仅依赖安全哈希和对称安全通信，以克服现有系统的局限性。该协议具有每节点的平均通信复杂度为$\mathcal{O}(\lambda n \log(n))$比特/信标，显著降低了计算成本，尤其在量子安全方面，通过使用安全哈希函数对抗量子攻击。在一个包含136个节点的全球分布测试环境中，HashRand每分钟能产生78个信标，比Spurt快至少5倍。此外，HashRand的应用实例包括实现了一个Post-Quantum安全的异步SMR协议，对于16个节点的WAN环境，响应率超过135k交易/秒，延迟仅为2.3秒。 <div>
Regular access to unpredictable and bias-resistant randomness is important for applications such as blockchains, voting, and secure distributed computing. Distributed random beacon protocols address this need by distributing trust across multiple nodes, with the majority of them assumed to be honest. Numerous applications across the blockchain space have led to the proposal of several distributed random beacon protocols, with some already implemented. However, many current random beacon systems rely on threshold cryptographic setups or exhibit high computational costs, while others expect the network to be partial or bounded synchronous. To overcome these limitations, we propose HashRand, a computation and communication-efficient asynchronous random beacon protocol that only demands secure hash and pairwise secure channels to generate beacons. HashRand has a per-node amortized communication complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\lambda n \log(n))$ bits per beacon. The computational efficiency of HashRand is attributed to the two orders of magnitude lower time of a one-way Hash computation compared to discrete log exponentiation. Interestingly, besides reduced overhead,  HashRand achieves Post-Quantum security by leveraging the secure Hash function against quantum adversaries, setting it apart from other random beacon protocols that use discrete log cryptography. In a geo-distributed testbed of $n=136$ nodes, HashRand produces 78 beacons per minute, which is at least 5x higher than Spurt [IEEE S\&amp;P'22]. We also demonstrate the practical utility of HashRand by implementing a Post-Quantum secure Asynchronous SMR protocol, which has a response rate of over 135k transactions per second at a latency of $2.3$ seconds over a WAN for $n=16$ nodes.

总结:
本文设计了首个可扩展的防胁迫区块链投票方案，支持私人差额投票权和一层液体民主。该方案复杂度为O(n)，其中n为选民数，将球票大小从张等人的Θ(m)减少到Θ(1)，m为专家和/或候选人数量。它保证了球票隐私、可验证性和防胁迫性。实验表明，与VoteAgain相比，该方案在大量选民和高额外球票率选举中的计票速度超过6倍。这项工作有望解决区块链投票中的胁迫问题，并提升系统的效率。 <div>
Typically, a decentralized collaborative blockchain decision-making mechanism is realized by remote voting. To date, a number of blockchain voting schemes have been proposed; however, to the best of our knowledge, none of these schemes achieve coercion-resistance. In particular, for most blockchain voting schemes, the randomness used by the voting client can be viewed as a witness/proof of the actual vote, which enables improper behaviors such as coercion and vote-buying. Unfortunately, the existing coercion-resistant voting schemes cannot be directly adopted in the blockchain context. In this work, we design the first scalable coercion-resistant blockchain voting scheme that supports private differential voting power and 1-layer liquid democracy as introduced by Zhang et al. (NDSS '19). Its overall complexity is $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of voters. Moreover, the ballot size is reduced from Zhang et al.'s $\Theta(m)$ to $\Theta(1)$, where $m$ is the number of experts and/or candidates. We formally prove that our scheme has ballot privacy, verifiability, and coercion-resistance. We implement a prototype of the scheme and the evaluation result shows that our scheme's tally procedure is more than 6x faster than VoteAgain (USENIX '20) in an election with over 10,000 voters and over 50\% extra ballot rate.

<div> 关键词：secure two-party computation, lookup tables (LUTs), $\mathsf{ROTL}$, FLUTE, secure LLM inference.

总结:
本文主要关注在大型语言模型的隐私保护下，如何通过安全的两方计算进行模型推理。研究者提出了$\mathsf{ROTL}$，一种针对查找表（LUT）评估的高效安全协议，相比现有最先进方法FLUTE，$\mathsf{ROTL}$在性能上分别有11.6倍和155倍的提升。特别地，$\mathsf{ROTL}$支持算术共享，而FLUTE仅限于布尔共享。文章还优化了FLUTE以支持布尔共享，显著减少了在线性能的带宽需求。这些改进对于保障用户隐私的同时提高大型语言模型的推理效率具有重要意义。 <div>
As large language models (LLMs) continue to gain popularity, concerns about user privacy are amplified, given that the data submitted by users for inference may contain sensitive information. Therefore, running LLMs through secure two-party computation (a.k.a. secure LLM inference) has emerged as a prominent topic. However, many operations in LLMs, such as Softmax and GELU, cannot be computed using conventional gates in secure computation; instead, lookup tables (LUTs) have to be utilized, which makes LUT to be an essential primitive in secure LLM inference.

In this paper, we propose $\mathsf{ROTL}$, a secure two-party protocol for LUT evaluations. Compared with FLUTE (the state-of-the-art LUT presented at  Oakland '23), it achieves upto  11.6$\times$ speedup in terms of overall performance and 155$\times$ speedup in terms of online performance. Furthermore, $\mathsf{ROTL}$ can support arithmetic shares (which is required by secure LLM inference), whereas FLUTE can only support boolean shares. At the heart of $\mathsf{ROTL}$ is a novel protocol for secret-shared rotation, which allows two parties to generate additive shares of the rotated table without revealing the rotation offset. We believe this protocol is of independent interest. Based on $\mathsf{ROTL}$, we design a novel secure comparison protocol; compared with the state-of-the-art, it achieves a 2.4$\times$ bandwidth reduction in terms of online performance. 

To support boolean shares, we further provide an optimization for FLUTE, by reducing its computational complexity from $O(l\cdot n^2)$ to $O(n\log n+l\cdot n)$ and shifting $O(n\log n)$ computation to the preprocessing phase. As a result, compared with FLUTE, it achieves upto 10.8$\times$ speedup in terms of overall performance and 962$\times$ speedup in terms of online performance.

总结:<br />
文章提出了一种利用MinHash算法和CGGI FHE方案改进的加密集相似性计算方法。传统的FHE比较操作昂贵，尤其是对大量数据。通过引入高效的位级FHE友好的摘要函数(FFD)，替代Carter-Wegman哈希中的模运算，减少了在FHE环境中的复杂性和低效性。这种方法显著减少与直接计算Jaccard相似度所需的比较次数，并且天然支持多CPU和GPU并行处理，适用于隐私保护的文档抄袭检测等场景。总的来说，新方法提高了加密计算效率，降低了计算成本。 <div>
Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) enables arbitrary computation on encrypted data, but certain applications remain prohibitively expensive in the encrypted domain. As a case in point, comparing two encrypted sets of data is extremely computationally expensive due to the large number of comparison operators required. In this work, we propose a novel methodology for encrypted set similarity inspired by the MinHash algorithm and the CGGI FHE scheme. Doing comparisons in FHE requires comparators and multiplexers or an expensive approximation, which further increases the latency, especially when the goal is to compare two sets of data. The MinHash algorithm can significantly reduce the number of comparisons required by employing a special Carter-Wegman (CW) hash function as a key building block. However, the modulus operation in the CW hash becomes another key bottleneck because the encrypted sub-circuits required to perform the modular reduction are very large and inefficient in an FHE setting. Towards that end, we introduce an efficient bitwise FHE-friendly digest function (FFD) to employ as the cornerstone of our proposed encrypted set-similarity. In a Boolean FHE scheme like CGGI, the bitwise operations can be implemented efficiently with Boolean gates, which allows for faster evaluation times relative to standard Carter-Wegman constructions. Overall, our approach drastically reduces the number of comparisons required relative to the baseline approach of directly computing the Jaccard similarity coefficients, and is inherently parallelizable, allowing for efficient encrypted computation on multi-CPU and GPU-based cloud servers. We validate our approach by performing a privacy-preserving plagiarism detection across encrypted documents.

<div> 关键词：genomics, genome analysis, fully homomorphic encryption, MinHash, bloom filter.

总结:<br />这篇文章探讨了随着基因组学研究的发展，保护用户隐私和数据安全的挑战。作者提出两种基于全同态加密的方法，以在不泄露DNA序列的情况下进行比较。第一种方法是利用MinHash算法检测数据库中是否存在相似序列，另一种则是定制的布隆过滤器用于精确匹配。实验验证了这些方法在不同数据库规模下，无论使用GPU还是CPU云服务器，都能有效实现隐私保护下的基因组分析。 <div>
As the field of genomics continues to expand and more sequencing data is gathered, genome analysis becomes increasingly relevant for many users. For example, a common scenario entails users trying to determine if their DNA samples are similar to DNA sequences hosted in a larger remote repository. Nevertheless, end users may be reluctant to upload their DNA sequences, while the owners of remote genomics repositories are unwilling to openly share their database. To address this challenge, we propose two distinct approaches based on fully homomorphic encryption to preserve the privacy of the genomic data and enable queries directly on ciphertexts. The first is based on the ubiquitous MinHash algorithm and can determine if similar matches exist in the database, while the second involves a bespoke bloom filter construction for determining exact matches. We validate both approaches across various database sizes using both GPU and CPU-based cloud servers.

<div> 关键词：randomized distributed function computation, semantic communications, privacy, Wyner's common information, common randomness.

总结: <br />
本文研究了随机分布式函数计算中语义通信的应用，特别是在保证隐私的前提下减少通信负载。主要关注两点：<br />
1. 通过利用语义通信框架，结合远程源编码方法，可以在满足安全和隐私约束时，实现输入序列的随机化模拟，同时保证每个输入序列的地方差分隐私。
2. 文章提供了Wyner共同信息（WCI）的下界，这是协调-随机性速率区域的两个角点之一，该区域定义了随机分布式函数计算的极限。WCI对应于没有共享随机性的场景。
3. 对于连续随机变量，提出了数值方法来计算另一个角点，即无限共享随机性的情况。
4. 实例分析表明，即使在有限共享随机性情况下，语义通信也能显著降低通信需求，优于无失真压缩方法。
5. 结论指出，进一步研究有限共享随机性场景对于优化随机分布式函数计算具有重要意义。 <div>
Randomized distributed function computation refers to remote function computation where transmitters send data to receivers which compute function outputs that are randomized functions of the inputs. We study the applications of semantic communications in randomized distributed function computation to illustrate significant reductions in the communication load, with a particular focus on privacy. The semantic communication framework leverages generalized remote source coding methods, where the remote source is a randomized version of the observed data. Since satisfying security and privacy constraints generally require a randomization step, semantic communication methods can be applied to such function computation problems, where the goal is to remotely simulate a sequence at the receiver such that the transmitter and receiver sequences follow a target probability distribution. Our performance metrics guarantee (local differential) privacy for each input sequence, used in two different distributed function computation problems, which is possible by using strong coordination methods. 

This work provides lower bounds on Wyner's common information (WCI), which is one of the two corner points of the coordination-randomness rate region characterizing the ultimate limits of randomized distributed function computation. The WCI corresponds to the case when there is no common randomness shared by the transmitter and receiver. Moreover, numerical methods are proposed to compute the other corner point for continuous-valued random variables, for which an unlimited amount of common randomness is available. Results for two problems of practical interest illustrate that leveraging common randomness can decrease the communication load as compared to the WCI corner point significantly. We also illustrate that semantic communication gains over lossless compression methods are achieved also without common randomness, motivating further research on limited common randomness scenarios.

<div> 关键词：Cross-chain dApps, Complete atomicity, Avalon, State synchronization, Cosmos ecosystem.

总结:<br />Avalon是一个创新的跨链去中心化应用（dApp）交易执行框架，它首次实现了完整的原子性。通过在原生状态之上引入多层状态缓存，Avalon有效地管理状态转换，确保复杂任务的正确执行。对于并发的跨链交易，Avalon不仅解决了链内的冲突，还通过一种新颖的状态同步协议处理不同区块链之间的潜在不一致，实现串行化的跨链执行。Avalon使用Cosmos生态系统的智能合约进行实现，并在实验中展示了其承诺性能，即使在冲突情况下，也具有可接受的延迟和gas消耗。 <div>
Cross-chain Decentralized Applications (dApps) are increasingly popular for their ability to handle complex tasks across various blockchains, extending beyond simple asset transfers or swaps. However, ensuring all dependent transactions execute correctly together, known as complete atomicity, remains a challenge. Existing works provide financial atomicity, protecting against monetary loss, but lack the ability to ensure correctness for complex tasks. In this paper, we introduce Avalon, a transaction execution framework for cross-chain dApps that guarantees complete atomicity for the first time. Avalon achieves this by introducing multiple state layers above the native one to cache state transitions, allowing for efficient management of these state transitions. Most notably, for concurrent cross-chain transactions, Avalon resolves not only intra-chain conflicts but also addresses potential inconsistencies between blockchains via a novel state synchronization protocol, enabling serializable cross-chain execution. We implement Avalon using smart contracts in Cosmos ecosystem and evaluate its commitment performance, demonstrating acceptable latency and gas consumption even under conflict cases.

<title>Practical Non-interactive Multi-signatures, and a Multi- to Aggregate Signatures Compiler</title>

<div> 关键词：fNIM, fNIA, $\mathsf{dms}$, multi-to-aggregate compiler, verification time

总结:
本文提出了一种新的高效非交互式多签名方案($\mathsf{dms}$)，解决了现有fNIM的两个关键问题。首先，$\mathsf{dms}$通过添加Schnorr PoPs简化了Boldyreva的对称配对基础fNIM，同时提供了更好的性能和在小群体中的快速验证。其在AGM模型下的安全性证明是主要技术贡献，具有大约128位的DL安全保证。其次，文章介绍了一个简单的编译器$\mathcal{M}to\mathcal{A}$，将任何fNIM转换为适合聚合具有公共前缀消息的fNIA，如Diem中应用$\mathsf{dms}$后的例子，验证速度显著提升。总的来说，$\mathsf{dms}$和$\mathcal{M}to\mathcal{A}$优化了签名效率和安全性，适用于大规模共识协议。 <div>
In a fully non-interactive multi- , resp. aggregate-, signature scheme (fNIM, resp. fNIA), signatures issued by many signers on the same message, resp. on different messages, can be succinctly ``combined'', resp. ``aggregated''.
fNIMs are used in the Ethereum consensus protocol, to produce the certificates of validity of blocks which are to be verified by billions of clients. fNIAs are used in some PBFT-like consensus protocols, such as the production version of Diem by Aptos, to replace the forwarding of many signatures by a new leader. In this work we address three complexity bottlenecks.
(i) fNIAs have larger cost than fNIMs, e.g., we observe that the fNIA of BGLS (Eurocrypt'03) over 3000 signatures, takes 100x longer verification time than a batch verification of 3000 Schnorr signatures.
(ii) fNIMs impose that each verifier processes the setup published by the group of potential signers. This processing consists either in verifying proofs of possession (PoPs), such as in Pixel (Usenix'20) and in the IETF'22 draft inherited from Ristenpart-Yilek (Eurocrypt'07), which costs a product of pairings over all published keys. Or, it consists in re-randomizing the keys, such as in SMSKR (FC'24).
(iii) Existing proven security bounds on efficient fNIMs do not give any guarantee in practical curves with 256bits-large groups, such as BLS12-381 (used in Ethereum) or BLS12-377 (used in Zexe). Thus, computing in much larger curves is required to have provable guarantees.

Our first contribution is a new fNIM called $\mathsf{dms}$, it addresses both (ii) and (iii).
It is as simple as adding Schnorr PoPs to the schoolbook pairing-based fNIM of Boldyreva (PKC'03).
(ii) For a group of 1000 signers, processing these PoPs is $5+$ times faster than for the previous pairing-based PoPs, and $3+$ times faster than the processing of SMSKR, which had furthermore to be done for every new group member. 
(iii) In the algebraic group model (AGM), and given the current estimation of roughly 128 bits of security for the discrete logarithm (DL) in both the curves BLS12-381 and BLS12-377, then we prove a probability of forgery of $\mathsf{dms}$ no higher than about $2^{-93}$ for a time $2^{80}$ adversary.
This proof of security is our main technical contribution. The only related proof before was for an interactive Schnorr-based multi-signature scheme, using Schnorr PoPs. We observe a gap in its proof, which is that the adversary has not access to a signing oracle before publishing its PoPs, although it should have. On the one hand, the gap can easily be fixed in their context. But in our context of pairing-based multi-signatures, the signing oracle produces a correlated random string which significantly complicates our extraction of the keys of the adversary.
We finally provide another application of $\mathsf{dms}$, which is that it can be plugged in recent threshold signatures without setup (presented by Das et al at CCS'23, and Garg et al at SP'24), since these schemes implicitly build on any arbitrary BLS-based fNIM.

Our second contribution addresses (i), it is a very simple compiler: $\mathcal{M}to\mathcal{A}$ (multi-to-aggregate). It turns any fNIM into an fNIA, suitable for aggregation of signatures on messages with a prefix in common, with the restriction that a signer must not sign twice using the same prefix. The obtained fNIA is post-quantum as soon as the fNIM is, such as Chipmunk (CCS'23). We demonstrate the relevance for Diem by applying $\mathcal{M}to\mathcal{A}$ to $\mathsf{dms}$: the resulting fNIA enables to verify 39x faster an aggregate of 129 signatures, over messages with $7$ bits-long variable parts, than BGLS.

<div> 关键词：Multiparty Computation (MPC), Security proof, Simulator, Automated framework, Perfect soundness.

总结:<br />
该研究提出了一种通用的自动化框架，用于验证多方计算(MPC)协议在面对半诚实攻击时的完美安全性。该框架具有完美完备性，能证明BGW协议等实例在给定的攻击者设置下的安全性，且能在多项式时间内完成。与仅关注黑盒隐私的传统方法不同，该框架适用于任意MPC协议的验证。通过实现原型，研究展示了其有效性和效率，能在合理时间内自动证明BGW和B2A转换协议的半诚实安全。这种方法简化了MPC协议的安全证明过程，提高了实践中的检测能力。 <div>
Proving the security of a Multiparty Computation (MPC) protocol is a difficult task. Under the current simulation-based definition of MPC, a security proof consists of a simulator, which is usually specific to the concrete protocol and requires to be manually constructed, together with a theoretical analysis of the output distribution of the simulator and corrupted parties' views in the real world. This presents an obstacle in verifying the security of a given MPC protocol. Moreover, an instance of a secure MPC protocol can easily lose its security guarantee due to careless implementation, and such a security issue is hard to detect in practice. 

In this work, we propose a general automated framework to verify the perfect security of instances of MPC protocols against the semi-honest adversary. Our framework has perfect soundness: any protocol that is proven secure under our framework is also secure under the simulation-based definition of MPC. We demonstrate the completeness of our framework by showing that for any instance of the well-known BGW protocol, our framework can prove its security for every corrupted party set with polynomial time. Unlike prior work that only focuses on black-box privacy which requires the outputs of corrupted parties to contain no information about the inputs of the honest parties, our framework may potentially be used to prove the security of arbitrary MPC protocols.

We implement our framework as a prototype. The evaluation shows that our prototype automatically proves the perfect semi-honest security of BGW protocols and B2A (binary to arithmetic) conversion protocols in reasonable durations.

<div> 关键词：proxy signature, anonymity, timed delegation, revocability, blockchain

总结:<br />该文章提出了一种新的匿名、定时和可撤销的代理签名方案，填补了现有技术在满足时间限制、匿名性、撤销权限和政策执行等多方面需求上的空白。首先，通过基于Schnorr签名的可分割数字签名，实现安全的签名人身份令牌分配。其次，利用区块链作为公共公告板，结合时间锁定加密技术，确保签名人只能一次性使用令牌、在指定时间内代理签署以及在需要时撤销委托，同时保持全程去中心化和匿名性。文章还定义了代理签名的统一形式化概念，并证明了该方案符合这一概念，同时讨论了实际部署中的设计考量。 <div>
A proxy signature enables a party to delegate her signing power to another. This is useful in practice to achieve goals related to robustness, crowd-sourcing, and workload sharing. Such applications, especially in the blockchain model, usually require delegation to satisfy several properties, including time bounds, anonymity, revocability, and policy enforcement. Despite the large amount of work on proxy signatures in the literature, none of the existing schemes satisfy all these properties; even there is no unified formal notion that captures them. 

In this work, we close this gap and propose an anonymous, timed, and revocable proxy signature scheme. We achieve this in two steps: First, we introduce a tokenizable digital signature based on Schnorr signature allowing for secure distribution of signing tokens. Second, we utilize a public bulletin board, instantiated as a blockchain, and timelock encryption to support: (1) one-time usage of the signing tokens by tracking tokens used so far based on unique values associated to them, (2) timed delegation so that a proxy signer cannot sign outside a given period, and (3) delegation revocation allowing the original signer to end a delegation earlier than provisioned. All of these are done in a decentralized and anonymous way so that no one can tell that someone else signed on behalf of the original signer or even that a delegation took place. We define a formal notion for proxy signatures capturing all these properties, and prove that our construction realizes this notion. We also discuss several design considerations addressing issues related to deployment in practice.

<div> 关键词：secret-sharing, adjacency list, $d$-normalized, oblivious conversion, secure operations

总结:
这篇文章介绍了一种方法，将秘密共享的邻接列表图形转换为更适用于多方计算（MPC）的$d$-规范化表示。这个过程分为两步：首先，安全地将节点重命名，从任意字符串转换为1到$V$的整数，以保持排序，这需要$O(\log V)$轮和$O((V+E)\log V)$次安全操作。其次，对已排序的整数节点进行$d$-规范化，仅需$O(1)$轮和$O(V+E)$次操作。这种转换有助于设计隐私保护的Dijkstra算法，实现$(V+E) \cdot \log V$次安全操作和$V \cdot \log V \cdot \log \log\log V$轮的复杂度。这种方法适用于常数数量的服务器，并适用于任何邻接列表表示，只要节点标签和权重能适应固定内存字节数。 <div>
Given a graph $G(V,E)$, represented as a secret-sharing of an adjacency list, we show how to obliviously convert it into an alternative, MPC-friendly secret-shared representation, so-called $d$-normalized replicated adjacency list (which we abbreviate to $d$-normalized), where the size of our new data-structure is only 4x larger -- compared to the original (secret-shared adjacency list) representation of $G$. Yet, this new data structure enables us to execute oblivious graph algorithms that simultaneously improve underlying graph algorithms' round, computation, and communication complexity. Our $d$-normalization proceeds in two steps: 

First, we show how for any graph $G$, given a secret-shared adjacency list, where vertices are arbitrary alphanumeric strings that fit into a single RAM memory word, we can efficiently and securely rename vertices to integers from $1$ to $V$  that will appear in increasing order in the resulting secret-shared adjacency list. The secure renaming takes $O(\log V)$ rounds and $O((V+E)\log V)$ secure operations. Our algorithm also outputs two secret-shared arrays: a mapping from integers to alphanumeric names and its sorted inverse. Of course, if the adjacency list is already in such a format, this step could be omitted.

Second, given a secret-shared adjacency list for any graph $G$, where vertices are integers from $1$ to $V$ and are sorted, we show an oblivious $d$-normalization algorithm that takes $O(1)$ rounds and $O(V+E)$ secure operations.

We believe that both conversions are of independent interest. We demonstrate the power of our data structures by designing a privacy-preserving Dijkstra's single-source shortest-path algorithm that simultaneously achieves $O((V +E) \cdot \log V)$ secure operations and   $O(V \cdot \log V \cdot  \log \log\log V)$ rounds. Our secure Dijkstra algorithm works for any adjacency list representation as long as all vertex labels and weights can individually fit into a constant number of RAM memory words. Our algorithms work for two or a constant number of servers in the honest but curious setting.  The limitation of our result (to only a constant number of servers) is due to our reliance on linear work and constant-round secure shuffle.

总结:<br />
本文提出了一种高效的第三方私密集合交集协议，仅需3轮通信，显著降低了计算工作量。该协议适用于对效率有高要求的真实世界应用，如接触者追踪，同时保护隐私。其算法改进和新技巧的应用使得计算复杂度达到近线性，即$O(n^{1+\varepsilon})$，适用于大数据集。此外，文章还首次探讨了第三方私密集合交集的基数功能，即仅第三方获知交集大小，而无其他信息。此基数功能的实现具有近线性计算复杂度。这些改进和创新为后量子时代的隐私保护提供了新的解决方案。 <div>
Third-party private set intersection (PSI) enables two parties, each holding a private set to compute their intersection and reveal the result only to an inputless third party. In this paper, we present an efficient third-party PSI protocol requiring only 3 communication rounds, while significantly lowering the computational workload compared to prior work. Our work is motivated by real-world applications such as contact tracing whereby expedition is essential while concurrently preserving privacy. Our construction attains a near-linear computational complexity of $O(n^{1+\varepsilon})$ for large dataset size $n$, where $\varepsilon>0$ is any fixed constant, and achieves post-quantum security. Our improvements stem from algorithmic changes and the incorporation of new techniques along with precise parameter selections to achieve a tight asymptotic bound. Furthermore, we also present a third-party PSI cardinality protocol which has not been explored in prior third-party PSI work. In a third-party PSI cardinality setting, only the third-party obtains the size of the intersection and nothing else. Our construction to achieve the cardinality functionality attains a quasilinear computational complexity for the third-party.

<div> 关键词：Secure Multi-party Computation (MPC), Decision Tree, Communication Complexity, Protocol, MP-SPDZ Framework

总结: <br />
该研究专注于改进决策树的隐私保护训练方法，利用secure multi-party computation (MPC)技术。文章的主要贡献在于提出了一种新的协议，将通信复杂度从$\mathcal{O}(hmN\log N)$降低到$\mathcal{O}(mN\log N + hmN + hN\log N)$，相比先前工作约减少了$\mathsf{min}(h, m, \log N)$。核心创新是一个能保持元素相对顺序的高效排序和分组方法。通过在MP-SPDZ框架中的实现，新协议比现有状态-of-the-art节省了10倍的通信并快9倍。这为处理大规模、高维度数据集的隐私保护决策树训练提供了更有效的解决方案。 <div>
Decision trees are an important class of supervised learning algorithms. When multiple entities contribute data to train a decision tree (e.g. for fraud detection in the financial sector), data privacy concerns necessitate the use of a privacy-enhancing technology such as secure multi-party computation (MPC) in order to secure the underlying training data. Prior state-of-the-art (Hamada et al.)  construct an MPC protocol for decision tree training with a communication of $\mathcal{O}(hmN\log N)$, when building a decision tree of height $h$ for a training dataset of $N$ samples, each having $m$ attributes.

In this work, we significantly reduce the communication complexity of secure decision tree training. 
We construct a protocol with communication complexity $\mathcal{O}(mN\log N + hmN + hN\log N)$, thereby achieving an improvement of $\approx \mathsf{min}(h, m, \log N)$ over Hamada et al. 
At the core of our technique is an improved protocol to regroup sorted private elements further into additional groups (according to a flag vector) while maintaining their relative ordering. We implement our protocol in the MP-SPDZ framework and show that it requires $10\times$ lesser communication and is $9\times$ faster than the state-of-the-art.

总结:<br />文章讨论了端到端加密消息应用中用户面临的一个挑战：如果丢失设备且无法访问解密密钥，将无法访问账户。为解决这个问题，Secure Value Recovery 3 (SVR3)被提出，它是一种秘密密钥恢复系统，通过在不同云提供商管理的不同硬件安全隔间（enclaves）之间分散信任，保护用户的解密密钥。SVR3是首个跨异构隔间部署的密钥恢复系统，降低了单一隔间成为攻击目标的风险。该系统利用回滚保护和故障 tolerance 技术适应隔间的安全性。SVR3的年度成本为0.0025美元/用户，用户恢复密钥的时间为365毫秒，这是一个罕见的操作。SVR3已在一个支持数亿真实用户的部署中实施，显示出处理大规模用户的能力。 <div>
End-to-end encrypted messaging applications ensure that an attacker cannot read a user's message history without their decryption keys. While this provides strong privacy, it creates a usability problem: if a user loses their devices and cannot access their decryption keys, they can no longer access their account. To solve this usability problem, users should be able to back up their account information with the messaging provider. For privacy, this backup should be encrypted and the provider should not have access to users' decryption keys. To solve this problem, we present Secure Value Recovery 3 (SVR3), a secret key recovery system that distributes trust across different types of hardware enclaves run by different cloud providers in order to protect users' decryption keys. SVR3 is the first deployed secret key recovery system to split trust across heterogeneous enclaves managed by different cloud providers: this design ensures that a single type of enclave does not become a central point of attack. SVR3 protects decryption keys via rollback protection and fault tolerance techniques tailored to the enclaves' security guarantees. SVR3 costs \$0.0025/user/year and takes 365ms for a user to recover their key, which is a rare operation. A part of SVR3 has been rolled out to millions of real users in a deployment with capacity for over 500 million users, demonstrating the ability to operate at scale.

<div> 关键词：隐私保护、机器学习、多党安全计算、固定点乘法、秘密分享。

总结:<br />
本文研究了在多服务器（$N \geq 3$）环境下进行隐私保护的机器学习问题。作者设计了新的多党安全固定点乘法协议，适用于三种秘密分享形式：复制、Shamir和加性共享，针对半诚实攻击提供安全保证。对于复制共享，还提出了一种对抗恶意攻击的高效协议。这些协议提高了通信效率，用于构建支持加法和固定点乘法（带截断）的任意算术电路的多党计算（MPC）协议。所有协议均基于标准的模拟安全性定义得到证明。其中，复制和Shamir共享协议需要至少一半服务器是诚实的，而加性共享协议可以容忍多数恶意行为。 <div>
Machine learning is widely used for a range of applications and is increasingly offered as a service by major technology companies. However, the required massive data collection raises privacy concerns during both training and inference. Privacy-preserving machine learning aims to solve this problem. In this setting, a collection of servers secret share their data and use secure multi-party computation to train and evaluate models on the joint data. All prior work focused on the scenario where the number of servers is two or three. In this work, we study the problem where there are $N \geq 3$ servers amongst whom the data is secret shared. 

A key component of machine learning algorithms is to perform fixed-point multiplication with truncation of secret shared decimal values. In this work, we design new protocols for multi-party secure fixed-point multiplication where each of the $N$ parties have one share each of the two values to be multiplied and receive one share of the product at the end of the protocol. We consider three forms of secret sharing - replicated, Shamir, and additive, and design an efficient protocol secure in the presence of a semi-honest adversary for each of the forms. Our protocols are more communication efficient than all prior work on performing multi-party fixed-point multiplication. Additionally, for replicated secret sharing, we design another efficient protocol that is secure in the presence of a malicious adversary. Finally, we leverage our fixed-point multiplication protocols to design secure multi-party computation (MPC) protocols for arbitrary arithmetic circuits that have addition and fixed-point multiplication with truncation gates. All our protocols are proven secure using a standard simulation based security definition. Our protocols for replicated and Shamir sharing work in the presence of an honest majority of parties while the one for additive sharing can tolerate a dishonest majority as well.

<div> 关键词: Waku, GossipSub, Rate Limiting Nullifiers (RLN), message propagation latency, decentralized messaging

总结:
Waku是一种注重隐私、通用和去中心化的消息传递协议。它结合了GossipSub（用于路由）和RLN（防止垃圾信息）技术。本文通过理论分析、大规模单节点模拟和多节点全球部署实验，评估了Waku的消息传播延迟。实验结果证实，中等大小（25 KB）的消息能在1秒内送达，满足像去中心化通信这样的应用场景需求。Waku在保证匿名性和可扩展性的同时，实现了满意的延迟性能。 <div>
Waku is a privacy-preserving, generalized, and decentralized messaging protocol suite. Waku uses GossipSub for message routing and Rate Limiting Nullifiers (RLN) for spam protection. GossipSub ensures fast and reliable peer-to-peer message delivery in a permissionless environment, while RLN enforces a common publishing rate limit using zero-knowledge proofs.

This paper presents a practical evaluation of message propagation latency in Waku. First, we estimate latencies analytically, building a simple mathematical model for latency under varying conditions. Second, we run a large-scale single-host simulation with 1000 nodes. Third, we set up a multi-host Waku deployment using five nodes in different locations across the world. Finally, we compare our analytical estimations to the results of the simulation and the real-world measurement.

The experimental results are in line with our theoretical model. Under realistic assumptions, medium-sized messages (25 KB) are delivered within 1 second. We conclude that Waku can achieve satisfactory latency for typical use cases, such as decentralized messengers, while providing scalability and anonymity.

<title>Exploiting Internal Randomness for Privacy in Vertical Federated Learning</title>

<div> 关键词：Vertical Federated Learning (VFL), Differential Privacy (DP), Variational Autoencoder (VAE), Empirical Local Differential Privacy (dELDP), Privacy Attacks.

总结:<br />
本文主要探讨了在Vertical Federated Learning (VFL)中，如何利用Variational Autoencoder (VAE)的内在随机性增强隐私保护。作者提出了一种新的差分隐私估计方法，称为距离基局部差分隐私(dELDP)，用于量化模型或模型组件的隐私参数。通过实验，dELDP在VAE中的应用显示出高达ε ≈ 6.4和δ = 2^{-32}的隐私值。研究发现，包含VAE的VFL系统对特征重建攻击具有稳健性，并且在对手拥有75%特征的标签推断攻击中，相比其他隐私增强方法表现出色。这表明，利用VAE的内部随机性可以在保持一定性能的同时提供有效的隐私保护。 <div>
Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) is becoming a standard collaborative learning paradigm with various practical applications. Randomness is essential to enhancing privacy in VFL, but introducing too much external randomness often leads to an intolerable performance loss. Instead, as it was demonstrated for other federated learning settings, leveraging internal randomness —as provided by variational autoencoders (VAEs) —can be beneficial. However, the resulting privacy has never been quantified so far, nor has the approach been investigated for VFL.
We therefore propose a novel differential privacy (DP) estimate, denoted as distance-based empirical local differential privacy (dELDP). It allows us to empirically bound DP parameters of models or model components, quantifying the internal randomness with appropriate distance and sensitivity metrics. We apply dELDP to investigate the DP of VAEs and observe values up to ε ≈ 6.4 and δ = 2−32. Based on this, to link the dELDP parameters to the privacy of VAE-including VFL systems in practice, we conduct comprehensive experiments on the robustness against state-of-the-art privacy attacks. The results illustrate that the VAE system is robust against feature reconstruction attacks and outperforms other privacy-enhancing methods for VFL, especially when the adversary holds 75% of the features during label inference attacks.

<div> 关键词：Decentralized Multi-Client Functional Encryption (DMCFE), Inner Products, Function-Hiding, Random Oracle Model, Security Guarantees.

总结:
本文探讨了去中心化的多客户端功能加密（DMCFE）的新构造，特别关注于内积函数的保密性。作者提出了一种新的证明方法，为这一构造提供了强大的随机 Oracle 模型下的安全保证。与之前仅在选择性攻击下证明安全性的构造不同，这个新方案允许对手进行适应性查询，包括带有重复消息标签的挑战密文和固定数量重复密钥标签的挑战密钥。这增加了对敏感函数（如机器学习模型）的保护。总的来说，研究者通过改进技术增强了多客户端功能加密在实际应用中的安全性。 <div>
Decentralized Multi-Client Functional Encryption (DMCFE) extends the basic functional encryption to multiple clients that do not trust each other. They can independently encrypt the multiple plaintext-inputs to be given for evaluation to the function embedded in the functional decryption key, defined by multiple parameter-inputs. And they keep control on these functions as they all have to contribute to the generation of the functional decryption keys. Tags can be used in the ciphertexts and the keys to specify which inputs can be combined together. As any encryption scheme, DMCFE provides privacy of the plaintexts. But the functions associated to the functional decryption keys might be sensitive too (e.g. a model in machine learning). The function-hiding property has thus been introduced to additionally protect the function evaluated during the decryption process.

  In this paper, we provide new proof techniques to analyze a new concrete construction of function-hiding DMCFE for inner products, with strong security guarantees in the random oracle model: the adversary can adaptively query multiple challenge ciphertexts and multiple challenge keys, with unbounded repetitions of the same message tags in the ciphertext-queries and a fixed polynomially-large number of repetitions of the same key tags in the key-queries, allowing static corruption of the secret encryption keys. Previous constructions were proven secure in the selective setting only.

<div> 关键词: 电子签名、eIDAS、智能卡、移动平台、独控制。

总结:<br />该文章探讨了2014年欧洲eIDAS法规对电子签名和强电子认证的要求，特别是关于“独控制”的变化。传统的智能卡通过用户直接与依赖方交互实现独控制，但eIDAS允许将用户互动外包给中间服务，如移动应用。然而，移动设备的加密硬件有限，无法支持复杂的密钥控制（如PIN）。作者提出一种新的设计，旨在为标准移动平台提供类似智能卡的独控制，满足eIDAS的严格要求。此外，文章还提及了基于SECDSA的欧洲数字身份钱包方案，这是eIDAS更新的一部分。这种设计确保即使在使用移动设备时，也能保持用户对电子签名的独控制，增强电子交易的安全性。 <div>
The 2014 European eIDAS regulation regulates strong electronic authentication and legally binding electronic signatures. Both require user "sole control". Historically smartcards are used based on direct interaction between user and relying party. Here sole control is provided by giving users both physical possession and control of the cryptographic key used for signing/authentication through a PIN.
Such **classical** sole control is required in the 1999 electronic signature directive by some interpretations.
The eIDAS regulation repeals the directive and explicitly relaxes its sole control requirements in a trade-off between security and usability.
This allows user interaction to be outsourced to intermediary parties (authentication providers, signing services). This also allows mobile applications as user friendly alternatives for smartcards. However, current mobile platforms are only equipped with limited cryptographic hardware not supporting secure knowledge factors (PINs) controlling keys. The eIDAS relaxation raises concerns on sole control; intermediary parties should not be able to act as man-in-the-middle and impersonate users. In this paper we present a simple cryptographic design for signing and authentication on standard mobile platforms providing classical sole control. We argue that our design can meet the highest eIDAS requirements, effectively introducing a new signature category in a 2016 decision of the European Commission.
We also sketch a SECDSA based implementation of the European Digital Identity Wallet recently proposed by the European Commission as part of the eIDAS regulation update.

<div> 关键词：Secure multiparty computation (MPC), Dishonest majority, Helper party (HP), Fairness, Asterisk framework.

总结:<br />
这篇文章探讨了在存在恶意多数方的多方计算(MPC)中，引入一个半诚实、非协作的辅助 party（HP）以提高效率和保障安全性的可能性。作者设计并实现了一个名为Asterisk的高效通用多党框架，它仅需少量调用HP，实现了公平性保障，适用于数百个参与者，且在预处理和在线时间上都优于现有协议，甚至能与诚实多数情况下的协议竞争。实验表明，Asterisk在预处理速度上比最佳方案快228-288倍，能支持大规模电路的快速计算，并成功应用于暗池实例，展示了其在实际应用中实现隐私保护的强大能力。 <div>
Secure multiparty computation$~$(MPC) enables privacy-preserving collaborative computation over sensitive data held by multiple mutually distrusting parties. Unfortunately, in the most natural setting where a majority of the parties are maliciously corrupt$~$(also called the $\textit{dishonest majority}$ setting), traditional MPC protocols incur high overheads and offer weaker security guarantees than are desirable for practical applications. In this paper, we explore the possibility of circumventing these drawbacks and achieving practically efficient dishonest majority MPC protocols with strong security guarantees by assuming an additional semi-honest, non-colluding helper party $\mathrm{HP}$. We believe that this is a more realistic alternative to assuming an honest majority, since many real-world applications of MPC involving potentially large numbers of parties$~$(such as dark pools) are typically enabled by a central governing entity that can be modeled as the $\mathrm{HP}$.

    In the above model, we are the first to design, implement and benchmark a practically-efficient and general multi-party framework, $\textsf{Asterisk}$. Our framework requires invoking $\mathrm{HP}$ only a constant number of times, achieves the strong security guarantee of $\textit{fairness}$ (either all parties learn the output or none do), scales to hundreds of parties, outperforms all existing dishonest majority MPC protocols, and is, in fact, competitive with state-of-the-art honest majority MPC protocols. Our experiments show that $\textsf{Asterisk}$ achieves $228-288\times$ speedup in preprocessing as compared to the best dishonest majority MPC protocol. With respect to online time, $\textsf{Asterisk}$ supports $100$-party evaluation of a circuit with $10^6$ multiplication gates in approximately $20$ seconds. We also implement and benchmark practically efficient and highly scalable dark pool instances using $\textsf{Asterisk}$. The corresponding run times showcase the effectiveness of $\textsf{Asterisk}$ in enabling efficient realizations of real-world privacy-preserving applications with strong security guarantees.

<title>Zero-Knowledge Proofs of Training for Deep Neural Networks</title>

<div> 关键词：零知识证明、深度神经网络（DNN）、迭代训练、GKR风格证明系统、证明大小和验证器时间。

总结:<br />
\name是一种专为深度神经网络设计的零知识证明（zkPoT），旨在保证隐私、效率和简洁性。它允许证人通过梯度下降迭代训练模型，每次迭代后生成一个证明，证明模型参数的正确性。文章的核心贡献包括：1）提出优化的GKR风格证明系统，降低证人成本；2）开发通用框架，实现多轮GKR证明的高效组合；3）实证表明，\name能处理大规模模型如VGG-11，证明大小仅1.63MB，验证器运行时间低至130毫秒，独立于迭代次数和数据集大小，显著提高效率。 <div>
A zero-knowledge proof of training (zkPoT) enables a party to prove that they have correctly trained a committed model based on a committed dataset without revealing any additional information about the model or the dataset. An ideal zkPoT should offer provable security and privacy guarantees, succinct proof size and verifier runtime, and practical prover efficiency. In this work, we present \name, a zkPoT targeted for deep neural networks (DNNs) that achieves all these goals at once. Our construction enables a prover to iteratively train their model via (mini-batch) gradient descent, where the number of iterations need not be fixed in advance; at the end of each iteration, the prover generates a commitment to the trained model parameters attached with a succinct zkPoT, attesting to the correctness of the executed iterations. The proof size and verifier time are independent of the number of iterations.

Our construction relies on two building blocks. First, we propose an optimized GKR-style (sumcheck-based) proof system for the gradient-descent algorithm with concretely efficient prover cost; this allows the prover to generate a proof for each iteration. We then show how to recursively compose these proofs across multiple iterations to attain succinctness. As of independent interest, we propose a generic framework for efficient recursive composition of GKR-style proofs, along with aggregatable polynomial commitments.

Benchmarks indicate that \name\ can handle the training of complex models such as VGG-11 with 10~million parameters and batch size~$16$. The prover runtime is $15$~minutes per iteration, which is $\mathbf{24 \times}$ faster than generic recursive proofs, with prover memory overhead $\mathbf{27\times}$ lower. The proof size is $1.63$~megabytes, and the verifier runtime is only $130$~milliseconds, where both are independent of the number of iterations and the size of the dataset.

<title>Secure Vickrey Auctions with Rational Parties</title>

<div> 关键词：second price auction, Vickrey auction, privacy, rational parties, dominant strategy equilibrium

总结:<br />
本文设计了一种无需拍卖人的第二价格（Vickrey）拍卖协议（SPA），确保了在理性、计算能力有限且注重隐私的参与者之间的完全隐私。该协议保护了最高出价和第二高出价者的身份不被泄露。参与者被模型化为自我利益驱动、遵循个人优势（通过合适的效用函数衡量）的理性个体，他们不会随意偏离协议。研究证明，在这种SPA中存在一种隐私保护的主导策略均衡，每个参与者都倾向于遵守协议。

该协议基于开源加密技术实现，具有高效性和低通信量。在一个拥有15名竞标者、每笔投标10位的实验中，SPA仅需1.26秒完成，总通信量为0.77MB。相比之下，类似条件下Atlas（半诚实）协议的运行时间增加了40%，通信量增加了87%。这表明作者的SPA协议在效率和隐私保护上具有显著优势。 <div>
In this work, we construct a second price (Vickrey) auction protocol (SPA), which does not require any auctioneers and ensures total privacy in the presence of rational parties participating in auction. In particular, the confidentiality of the highest bid and the identity of the second highest bidder are protected. We model the bidders participating in the second price auction as rational, computationally bounded and privacy-sensitive parties. These are self-interested agents who care about winning the auction more than learning about the private bids of other parties. A rational party does not deviate from the protocol arbitrarily but does so only for its own individual `advantage' -- without any consideration for others. Such an advantage is modeled using suitable utility functions. 

We show that for rational and computationally bounded parties participating in our second-price auctions protocol, there exists a privacy-preserving dominant strategy equilibrium in which every party prefers to follow the protocol rather than to deviate. 

Our protocol is implemented using open-source cryptographic constructs. Running our SPA protocol on commodity hardware with $15$ bidders,  with bids of length $10$ bits,  completes in $1.26$sec and has total communication of $0.77$MB whereas, under similar conditions, Atlas (semi-honest) protocol takes $40\%$ more time ($2.11$ sec) and $87\%$ more communication ($6.09$MB).

<title>FSSiBNN: FSS-based Secure Binarized Neural Network Inference with Free Bitwidth Conversion</title>

<div> 关键词：Secure neural network inference, Binarized neural networks (BNNs), Secure multi-party computation (MPC), Function secret sharing (FSS), Communication overhead.

总结:<br />
本文提出了一种名为FSSiBNN的安全二值神经网络（BNN）推理框架，旨在解决在使用MPC进行BNN推理时的隐私保护和通信效率问题。FSSiBNN利用函数秘密共享（FSS）实现免费的位宽转换，设计了一种位宽减半的参数编码方案，将位宽转换无缝融入FSS安全二值激活和最大池化协议中，显著减少了通信开销。通过预计算矩阵乘法和比较操作，FSSiBNN在实验中表现出色，相比XONN有7倍的更快推理速度和577倍的通信成本降低，相较于SecureBiNN和FLEXBNN，FSSiBNN在速度和通信效率上也有显著优势。 <div>
Neural network inference as a service enables a cloud server to provide inference services to clients. To ensure the privacy of both the cloud server's model and the client's data, secure neural network inference is essential. Binarized neural networks (BNNs), which use binary weights and activations, are often employed to accelerate inference. However, achieving secure BNN inference with secure multi-party computation (MPC) is challenging because MPC protocols cannot directly operate on values of different bitwidths and require bitwidth conversion. Existing bitwidth conversion schemes expand the bitwidths of weights and activations, leading to significant communication overhead.

To address these challenges, we propose FSSiBNN, a secure BNN inference framework featuring free bitwidth conversion based on function secret sharing (FSS). By leveraging FSS, which supports arbitrary input and output bitwidths, we introduce a bitwidth-reduced parameter encoding scheme. This scheme seamlessly integrates bitwidth conversion into FSS-based secure binary activation and max pooling protocols, thereby eliminating the additional communication overhead. Additionally, we enhance communication efficiency by combining and converting multiple BNN layers into fewer matrix multiplication and comparison operations. We precompute matrix multiplication tuples for matrix multiplication and FSS keys for comparison during the offline phase, enabling constant-round online inference.

In our experiments, we evaluated various datasets and models, comparing our results with state-of-the-art frameworks. Compared with the two-party framework XONN (USENIX Security '19), FSSiBNN achieves approximately 7$\times$ faster inference times and reduces communication overhead by about 577$\times$. Compared with the three-party frameworks SecureBiNN (ESORICS '22) and FLEXBNN (TIFS '23), FSSiBNN is approximately 2.5$\times$ faster in inference time and reduces communication overhead by 1.3$\times$ to 16.4$\times$.

<div> 关键词：attribute-based credentials (ABC), auditable, anonymity, revocability, contact tracing

总结:<br />该文章探讨了在疫情期间，隐私保护联系追踪系统的需求升级。作者将注意力转向了基于属性的凭证(ABC)方案，提出了一种可审计的ABC扩展，增加了审计能力，允许指定的审计机构撤销特定发行者的匿名性。为此，他们设计了可更新公钥的“可审计公钥”机制，并将其应用于Connolly等人的ABC构造中。此外，文章还改进了Wang等人的框架，提供了安全定义和协议构建，以及一个实现来展示设计的实用性。这个工作不仅解决了现有系统的局限，而且"可审计公钥"机制具有通用性，可能对其他加密技术有独立价值。 <div>
During the pandemic, the limited functionality of existing privacy-preserving contact tracing systems highlights the need for new designs. Wang et al. proposed an environmental-adaptive framework (CSS '21) but failed to formalize the security. The similarity between their framework and attribute-based credentials (ABC) inspires us to reconsider contact tracing from the perspective of ABC schemes. In such schemes, users can obtain credentials on attributes from issuers and prove the credentials anonymously (i.e., hiding sensitive information of both user and issuer). This work first extends ABC schemes with auditability, which enables designated auditing authorities to revoke the anonymity of particular issuers. For this purpose, we propose an ``auditable public key (APK)'' mechanism that extends the updatable public key by Fauzi et al. (AsiaCrypt '19). We provide formal security definitions regarding auditability and build our auditable ABC scheme by adding a DDH-based APK to Connolly et al.'s ABC construction (PKC '22). Note that the APK mechanism can be used as a plug-in for other cryptographic primitives and may be of independent interest. Finally, regarding contact tracing, we refine Wang et al.'s framework and present a formal treatment that includes security definitions and protocol construction. An implementation is provided to showcase the practicality of our design.

<div> 关键词：secret-sharing, 1-bit shares, corruption probability, error-correcting codes, binary erasure channel

总结:<br />
这篇文章探讨了一种新的随机模型，用于设计具有单比特份额的阈值秘密共享方案，以抵抗任意常数概率$p<0.5$的攻击。作者通过建立与纠错码在二进制擦除信道上达到容量的联系，提出了创新的构造方法。这些线性且可乘的方案有助于构建高效、实时的多方计算（MPC）协议，即使门电路按顺序实时到来，也能保证低通信量，每个AND门只需单比特通信，XOR门无需通信。这对于实现实时环境下的安全计算是一个重要突破。 <div>
The problem of minimizing the share size of threshold secret-sharing schemes is a basic research question that has been extensively studied. Ideally, one strives for schemes in which the share size equals the secret size. While this is achievable for large secrets (Shamir, CACM '79), no similar solutions are known for the case of binary, single-bit secrets. Current approaches often rely on so-called ramp secret sharing that achieves a constant share size at the expense of a slight gap between the privacy and the correctness thresholds. In the case of single-bit shares, this leads to a large gap which is typically unacceptable. The possibility of a meaningful notion of secret sharing scheme with 1-bit shares and almost optimal threshold has been left wide open. Of special interest is the case of threshold 0.5, which is motivated by information-theoretic honest-majority secure multiparty computation (MPC).

In this work, we present a new stochastic model for secret-sharing where each party is corrupted by the adversary with probability $p$, independently of the other parties, and correctness and privacy are required to hold with high probability over the choice of the corrupt parties. We present new secret sharing schemes with single-bit shares that tolerate any constant corruption probability $p<0.5$. Our construction is based on a novel connection between such stochastic secret-sharing schemes and error-correcting codes that achieve capacity over the binary erasure channel.

Our schemes are linear and multiplicative. We demonstrate the usefulness of the model by using our new schemes to construct MPC protocols with security against an adversary that passively corrupts an arbitrary subset of $0.499n$ of the parties, where the online communication per party consists of a single bit per AND gate and zero communication per XOR gate. Unlike competing approaches for communication-efficient MPC, our solution is applicable even in a real-time model in which the parties should compute a Boolean circuit whose gates arrive in real-time, one at a time, and are not known in advance.

<title>A New Fine Tuning Method for FHEW/TFHE Bootstrapping with IND-CPAD Security</title>

<div> 关键词：fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), FHEW, TFHE, IND-CPA-D security, key recovery attack

总结:<br />
文章讨论了全同态加密(FHE)方案，特别是FHEW和TFHE，这两种方法在处理加密数据的计算上表现出色。然而，它们的评估失败概率对参数选择敏感，导致必须选择过低的失败概率以抵抗Cheon等人的关键恢复攻击，这牺牲了运行效率。为解决这个问题，作者提出了一种新的FHEW/TFHE的提升方法，它允许精确地平衡运行时间和失败概率，同时提供易于实现的特性。新方法允许根据所需安全级别选择更合适的参数集，兼顾效率和安全性。 <div>
Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) schemes enable computations on encrypted data, making them a crucial component of privacy-enhancing technologies. 
Ducas and Micciancio introduced FHEW (Eurocrypt '15), and Chillotti et al. improved it in TFHE (Asiacrypt '16), both of which provide homomorphic binary (or larger) gate evaluations with fast latency due to their small parameters. 
However, their evaluation failure probability is highly sensitive to parameter selection, resulting in a limited set of viable parameters and a trade-off between failure probability and runtime.

Recently, Cheon et al. proposed a key recovery attack against FHEW/TFHE schemes based on a new security model for FHE, called IND-CPA-D security, which was first introduced by Li and Micciancio (Eurocrypt '21). 
To prevent this attack, it is necessary to make the failure probability negligible (e.g., $2^{-128}$). 
However, due to limited choice parameters, it is forced to use a parameter set with unnecessarily low failure probabilities than needed, causing inefficiencies in runtime.

We propose a new bootstrapping method for FHEW/TFHE, providing a precise balance between runtime and failure probability, and easy to implement.
The proposed methods enable the selection of parameter sets that achieve negligible failure probabilities for each desired security level while optimizing runtime.

<div> 关键词：Local differential privacy (LDP), malicious clients, input manipulation, output manipulation, verifiable LDP (VLDP).

总结: 这篇文章探讨了如何保护Local Differential Privacy (LDP)机制免受恶意客户端的攻击。作者提出了一种高效的方法，通过设计防止输入和输出操纵的Verifiable LDP (VLDP)方案，确保了数据隐私。VLDP完全防御输出操纵，使用签名数据防止输入攻击，仅需一次客户端与服务器交互，提高了系统的安全性。文章还提供了两种在常规模型下的VLDP方案和一种在shuffle模型下的实现，且具有良好的实践性，客户端运行时间少于2秒，服务器处理时间为每客户5-7毫秒。 <div>
Local differential privacy (LDP) is an efficient solution for providing privacy to client's sensitive data while simultaneously releasing aggregate statistics without relying on a trusted central server (aggregator) as in the central model of differential privacy. The shuffle model with LDP provides an additional layer of privacy, by disconnecting the link between clients and the aggregator, further improving the utility of LDP. However, LDP has been shown to be vulnerable to malicious clients who can perform both input and output manipulation attacks, i.e., before and after applying the LDP mechanism, to skew the aggregator's results. In this work, we show how to prevent malicious clients from compromising LDP schemes. Specifically, we give efficient constructions to prevent both input ánd output manipulation attacks from malicious clients for generic LDP algorithms. Our proposed schemes for verifiable LDP (VLDP), completely protect from output manipulation attacks, and prevent input attacks using signed data, requiring only one-time interaction between client and server, unlike existing alternatives [28, 33]. Most importantly, we are the first to provide an efficient scheme for VLDP in the shuffle model. We describe and prove secure, two schemes for VLDP in the regular model, and one in the shuffle model. We show that all schemes are highly practical, with client runtimes of < 2 seconds, and server runtimes of 5-7 milliseconds per client.

总结:<br />
Transformer神经网络因其在大型语言模型中的出色表现而备受关注。本文聚焦于这些模型的安全隐患，特别是Covert Channel（隐蔽信道）攻击。研究者利用加密手段在Claude.ai上实施了攻击，并发现该模型会记录用户查询。值得注意的是，攻击在两天内被察觉并阻止，这引发了两个关键问题：一是大语言模型可能过度收集用户数据，对隐私构成威胁；二是频繁的阻断可能导致学术界对于此类模型安全性的研究受限，难以重复实验。 <div>
Transformer neural networks have gained significant traction since their introduction, becoming pivotal across diverse domains. Particularly in large language models like Claude and ChatGPT, the transformer architecture has demonstrated remarkable efficacy. This paper provides a concise overview of transformer neural networks and delves into their security considerations, focusing on covert channel attacks and their implications for the safety of large language models. We present a covert channel utilizing encryption and demonstrate its efficacy in circumventing Claude.ai's security measures. Our experiment reveals that Claude.ai appears to log our queries and blocks our attack within two days of our initial successful breach.  This raises two concerns within the community: (1) The extensive logging of user inputs by large language models could pose privacy risks for users. (2) It may deter academic research on the security of such models due to the lack of experiment repeatability.

<div> 关键词：隐私保护、功能加密（FE）、SACfe、安全访问控制、内积属性。<br /><br />总结: 这篇文章探讨了在大规模数字应用中保护用户隐私的重要性，特别是针对云计算和机器学习服务。作者提出了一种新的属性基功能加密方案（SACfe），它提供了安全、细粒度的访问控制，同时隐藏用户属性和对数据的操作，确保数据保密性。SACfe特别支持对加密数据进行线性计算，并基于内积条件执行访问控制。文章还展示了SACfe如何用于在线生物识别，实现隐私保护的访问控制。此外，文章还介绍了一种适用于无限长度消息和函数的线性FE，其控制基于单调span程序。实验结果表明，该方案在实践中具有高效性，通过CiFEr库实现了这些协议。 <div>
Privacy is a major concern in large-scale digital applications, such as cloud-computing, machine learning services, and access control. Users want to protect not only their plain data but also their associated attributes (e.g., age, location, etc). Functional encryption (FE) is a cryptographic tool that allows fine-grained access control over encrypted data. However, existing FE fall short as they are either inefficient and far from reality or they leak sensitive user-specific information.

We propose SACfe, a novel attribute-based FE scheme that provides secure, fine-grained access control and hides both the user’s attributes and the function applied to the data, while preserving the data’s confidentiality. Moreover, it enables users to encrypt unbounded-length messages along with an arbitrary number of hidden attributes into ciphertexts. We design SACfe, a protocol for performing linear computation on encrypted data while enforcing access control based on inner product predicates. We show how SACfe can be used for online biometric authentication for privacy-preserving access control. As an additional contribution, we introduce an attribute-based linear FE for unbounded length of messages and functions where access control is realized by monotone span programs. We implement our protocols using the CiFEr cryptographic library and show its efficiency for practical settings.

<div> 关键词：Layer-2解决方案、比特币指数器、Turing-incomplete、INDECURE、数据完整性

总结: <br />
本文讨论了比特币生态系统中的发展，尤其是Layer-2解决方案（如inscriptions和ordinal protocols）在提高交易效率和创建独特资产方面的贡献。然而，比特币脚本的限制性使其需要使用指数器进行复杂操作。INDECURE是一个提出的新型模块化指数器架构，它旨在解决传统分布式指数器的安全问题，如Sybil攻击。INDECURE利用多项式承诺作为检查点，通过数据证明确保状态信息的可靠性，减少验证过程中的计算和存储需求。初步评估显示，INDECURE在BRC20、Bitmap和satsnames等协议中表现出更好的性能，为比特币的去中心化和高效应用提供了坚实的基础。 <div>
The Bitcoin ecosystem has continued to evolve beyond its initial promises of decentralization, transparency, and security. Recent advancements have notably been made with the integration of Layer-2 solutions, which address scalability issues by offloading transactions from the main blockchain. This facilitates faster and more cost-effective transactions while maintaining integrity. The advent of inscriptions and ordinal protocols has further broadened the spectrum of capabilities, enabling the creation of unique, indivisible assets on the blockchain. Despite these technological strides, the inherent limitations of Bitcoin's script being Turing-incomplete restrict complex executions directly on the blockchain, necessitating the use of Bitcoin indexers. These indexers act as off-chain execution layers, allowing for the incorporation of Turing-complete programming languages to manage and update state transitions based on blockchain data. However, this off-chain solution introduces challenges to data integrity and availability, compounded by the decentralized nature of blockchain which complicates data maintenance and accuracy.

To address these challenges, we propose a new modular indexer architecture that enables a fully decentralized and user-verified network, mitigating the risks associated with traditional decentralized indexer networks susceptible to Sybil attacks. Our solution, INDECURE, leverages polynomial commitments as checkpoints to streamline the verification process, significantly reducing the overhead associated with integrity checks of state transitions. By implementing a robust data attestation procedure, INDECURE ensures the reliability of state information against malicious alterations, facilitating trustless verifications by users. Our preliminary evaluations of INDECURE across various indexer protocols—BRC20, Bitmap, and satsnames—demonstrate its superiority in reducing computation time and data block size while maintaining high integrity in state transitions. This modular approach not only enhances the security and efficiency of Bitcoin's off-chain executions but also sets a foundational layer for scalable, secure blockchain applications.

<div> 关键词：Verifiable Random Function (VRF), Aggregatable Key-Evolving VRF (A-KE-VRF), Proof-of-Stake (PoS), Proofs of Proof-of-Stake (PoPoS), Encryption to the Future (EtF)

总结:<br />
本文提出了一种新的可聚合密钥演进Verifiable Random Function (A-KE-VRF)，它具有聚合和密钥演进的特性。A-KE-VRF有助于提升Proof-of-Stake (PoS)区块链的块大小效率，优化PoPoS，并构建了面向未来的加密和来自过去的认证方案。这些技术对于YOSO MPC框架至关重要，提供了增强的安全性。通过结合这些功能，A-KE-VRF为未来加密协议设计开辟了新路径。 <div>
A Verifiable Random Function (VRF) can be evaluated on an input by a prover who holds a secret key, generating a pseudorandom output and a proof of output validity that can be verified using the corresponding public key. VRFs are a central building block of committee election mechanisms that sample parties to execute tasks in cryptographic protocols, e.g. generating blocks in a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain or executing a round of MPC protocols. We propose the notion, and a matching construction, of an Aggregatable Key-Evolving VRF (A-KE-VRF) with the following extra properties: 1. Aggregation: combining proofs for several VRF evaluations of different inputs under different secret keys into a single constant size proof; 2. Key-Evolving: preventing adversaries who corrupt a party (learning their secret key) from ``forging'' proofs of past VRF evaluations. As an immediate application, we improve on the block size of PoS blockchains and on the efficiency of Proofs of Proof-of-Stake (PoPoS). Furthermore, the A-KE-VRF notion allows us to construct Encryption to the Future (EtF) and Authentication from the Past (AfP) schemes with a Key-Evolving property, which provides forward security.  An EtF scheme allows for sending a message to a party who is randomly selected to execute a role in the future, while an AfP scheme allows for this party to authenticate their messages as coming from a past execution of this role. These primitives are essential for realizing the YOSO MPC Framework (CRYPTO'21).

<div> 关键词：subliminal channel, blockchain, secret-recoverable splittable signature, public-key, random oracle model

总结:<br />
本文提出了一种利用区块链上秘密可恢复分割签名方案的公开密钥隐秘通信渠道。这种设计在随机Oracle模型下，在常见加密假设下是不可检测的。方法适用于98种顶级加密货币中使用的98种秘密可恢复分割签名方案，仅增加每条消息一个签名的常量开销。研究还分析了比特币、Monero和RippleNet网络的适用性，并提供了比特币和RippleNet的原型实现。这一创新为匿名但可追踪的通信提供了一种新的可能，增加了信息安全的隐蔽性。 <div>
Messengers have become an essential means of interpersonal interaction. Yet untraceable private communication remains an elusive goal, as most messengers hide content, but not communication patterns. The knowledge of communication patterns can by itself reveal too much, as happened, e.g., in the context of the Arab Spring. Subliminal channels in cryptographic systems enable untraceable private communication in plain sight. In this context, bulletin boards in the form of blockchains are a natural object for subliminal communication: accessing them is innocuous, as they rely on distributed access for verification and extension. At the same time, blockchain users generate hundreds of thousands of transactions per day that are individually signed and placed on the blockchain. Thus, blockchains may serve as innocuous repository for publicly accessible cryptographic transactions where subliminal channels can be placed. This significantly increases the availability of publicly accessible cryptographic transactions where subliminal channels can be placed.
In this paper, we propose a public-key subliminal channel using secret-recoverable splittable signature schemes on blockchains and prove that our construction is undetectable in the random oracle model under common cryptographic assumptions. Our approach is applicable to any secret-recoverable splittable signature scheme and introduces a constant overhead of a single signature per message. Such schemes are used by 98 of the top 100 cryptocurrencies. We also analyze the applicability of our approach to the Bitcoin, Monero, and RippleNet networks and present proof of concept implementations for Bitcoin and RippleNet.

<div> 关键词：remote attestation (RA), transparency, zkSNARKs, non-interactive, publicly provable

总结:
本文介绍了一种新型的远程验证协议(zRA)，它利用零知识 Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (zkSNARKs)技术，解决了现有RA协议的透明度问题。zRA无需预共享密钥或访问敏感数据，实现了无交互、公开可验证的设备验证。它不依赖在线服务，也不增加额外的安全假设，适用于点对点和发布/订阅网络结构。作者还开发了开源实现，并表明zRA适用于公共许可区块链，用于存储和保护免受DoS攻击的认证数据。总的来说，zRA促进了更广泛地采用远程验证技术，保证了系统的可信度和审计性。 <div>
Remote attestation (RA) protocols have been widely
used to evaluate the integrity of software on remote devices.
Currently, the state-of-the-art RA protocols lack a crucial feature: transparency. This means that the details of the final
attestation verification are not openly accessible or verifiable by
the public. Furthermore, the interactivity of these protocols often
limits attestation to trusted parties who possess privileged access
to confidential device data, such as pre-shared keys and initial
measurements. These constraints impede the widespread adoption
of these protocols in various applications.
In this paper, we introduce zRA, a non-interactive, transparent, and publicly provable RA protocol based on zkSNARKs.
zRA enables verification of device attestations without the need
for pre-shared keys or access to confidential data, ensuring a
trustless and open attestation process. This eliminates the reliance
on online services or secure storage on the verifier side. Moreover,
zRA does not impose any additional security assumptions beyond
the fundamental cryptographic schemes and the essential trust
anchor components on the prover side (i.e., ROM and MPU).
The zero-knowledge attestation proofs generated by devices have
constant size regardless of the network complexity and number
of attestations. Moreover, these proofs do not reveal sensitive
information regarding internal states of the device, allowing verification by anyone in a public and auditable manner. We conduct
an extensive security analysis and demonstrate scalability of zRA
compared to prior work. Our analysis suggests that zRA excels
especially in peer-to-peer and Pub/Sub network structures. To
validate the practicality, we implement an open-source prototype
of zRA using the Circom language. We show that zRA can be
securely deployed on public permissionless blockchains, serving
as an archival platform for attestation data to achieve resilience
against DoS attacks.

<div> 关键词：secure merge, uniformly random lists, near linear, logarithmic overheads, implementation

总结:<br />
本文主要探讨了在处理随机列表的 secure merge 问题上，提出了一种新的协议。该协议实现了近乎线性的通信和计算复杂度，每轮运行时间为 $O(\log\log n)$，对于长度为 $2^{20}$ 的列表，运行时间和通信量比现有状态提高了一个数量级。与之前的理论工作相比，虽然在理论上的最优时间复杂度有所差距，但实证表明，新协议在实际应用中更为高效。此外，该协议还扩展到了来自任意分布的列表，尤其是当列表近似同分布时，效率接近于随机列表，从而显著提升了 PSI 和 Secure Join 等关键应用的性能。 <div>
Secure merge refers to the problem of merging two sorted lists. The problem appears in different settings where each list is held by one of two parties, or the lists are themselves shared among two or more parties. The output of a secure merge protocol is secret shared. Each variant of the problem offers many useful applications.

The difficulty in designing secure merge protocols vis-a-vis insecure merge protocols (which work in linear time with a single pass over the lists) has to do with operations having to be oblivious or data-independent. In particular, the protocol cannot leak the positions of items of each list in the final merged list. On account of this, sorting-based secure merge protocols have been a common solution to the problem. However, as they introduce (poly)logarithmic overheads, there has been active investigation into the task of building (near) linear time secure merge protocols. Most recently, Hemenway et al. put forth a protocol for secure merge that does achieve linear communication and computation and a round complexity of $O({\log\log n})$, where $n$ is the length of the lists being merged. While this shows the feasibility of a linear time secure merge, it still leaves room for the design of a concretely efficient linear time secure merge.

In this work, we consider a relaxation of the problem where the lists are uniformly random. We show a secure merge protocol for uniformly random lists that achieves $O({n\log\log n})$, i.e., near linear communication and computation and a round complexity of $O({\log\log n})$, where $n$ is the length of the lists being merged. Our protocol design is general and can be instantiated in a variety of settings so long as the building blocks (basic ones such as comparisons and shuffles) can be realized in said settings. Although we do not achieve the same asymptotic guarantees as Hemenway et al., our work is concretely efficient. We implement our protocol and compare it to the state of the art sorting protocols and demonstrate an order of magnitude improvement in running times and communication for lists of size of $2^{20}$. 

We also extend our protocol to work for lists sampled from arbitrary distributions. In particular, when the lists are (close to) identically distributed, we achieve the same efficiency as uniform lists. This immediately improve the performance of many crucial applications including PSI & Secure Join, thus illustrating the significance and applicability of our protocol in practice.

<div> 关键词：Decentralized Finance（去中心化金融）、Automated Market Makers（自动市场 maker，AMM）、Blockchain、Scalability（可扩展性）、ammBoost。

总结: <br />
文章讨论了去中心化金融（DeFi）中自动市场 makers（AMM）的可扩展性问题，尤其是在区块链上处理大量交易时产生的存储和交易成本问题。为解决这一问题，作者提出了一种名为ammBoost的新型侧链架构，旨在减少链上交易、提高吞吐量并支持区块链修剪。该系统采用多种技术确保AMM的正确性和安全性。通过构建Uniswap启发式用例的原型，实验结果表明ammBoost能将交易气体成本降低94.53%，链增长至少减少80%，并且能够支持比实际Uniswap高出500倍的日流量。总的来说，ammBoost是一种有效的解决方案，旨在优化AMM在DeFi中的性能和可持续性。 <div>
Automated market makers (AMMs) are a form of decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges and considered a prime example of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications. Their popularity and high trading activity have resulted in millions of on-chain transactions leading to serious scalability issues. In this paper, we address the on-chain storage overhead problem of AMMs by utilizing a new sidechain architecture as a layer 2 solution, building a system called ammBoost. Our system reduces the amount of on-chain transactions, boosts throughput, and supports blockchain pruning. We devise several techniques to enable layer 2 processing for AMMs while preserving correctness and security of the underlying AMM. We also build a proof-of-concept of ammBoost for a Uniswap-inspired use case to empirically evaluate its performance. Our experiments show that ammBoost decreases the gas cost by 94.53% and the chain growth by at least 80%, and that it can support up to 500x of the daily traffic volume observed for Uniswap in practice.

<div> 关键词：Reticulum, sharding, blockchain, scalability, adversarial nodes

总结: <br />
Reticulum是一种创新的分片协议，旨在解决区块链网络中的可扩展性和安全性问题。它采用两阶段设计，分为控制和处理分片，以应对不同类型的攻击。控制分片确保网络的多数诚实节点，而处理分片负责交易处理，通过一致同意减少参与验证的节点，实现高吞吐量。在出现争议时，控制分片作为仲裁者。实验表明，Reticulum在保持高交易速度的同时，具有更强的抗攻击性，相较于现有协议更具优势。 <div>
Sharding is a critical technique that enhances the scalability of blockchain technology. However, existing protocols often assume adversarial nodes in a general term without considering the different types of attacks, which limits transaction throughput at runtime because attacks on liveness could be mitigated. There have been attempts to increase transaction throughput by separately handling the attacks; however, they have security vulnerabilities. This paper introduces Reticulum, a novel sharding protocol that overcomes these limitations and achieves enhanced scalability in a blockchain network without security vulnerabilities.

Reticulum employs a two-phase design that dynamically adjusts transaction throughput based on runtime adversarial attacks on either or both liveness and safety. It consists of `control' and `process' shards in two layers corresponding to the two phases. Process shards are subsets of control shards, with each process shard expected to contain at least one honest node with high confidence. Conversely, control shards are expected to have a majority of honest nodes with high confidence. Reticulum leverages unanimous voting in the first phase to involve fewer nodes in accepting/rejecting a block, allowing more parallel process shards. The control shard finalizes the decision made in the first phase and serves as a lifeline to resolve disputes when they surface.

Experiments demonstrate that the unique design of Reticulum empowers high transaction throughput and robustness in the face of different types of attacks in the network, making it superior to existing sharding protocols for blockchain networks.

<div> 关键词：non-interactive verifiable secret sharing (NI-VSS), class groups (cgVSS), range proof, public verifiability, non-interactive distributed key generation (NI-DKG).

总结:
本文提出了一种基于类群的非交互式可验证秘密共享方案(cgVSS)，它不依赖于范围证明，利用类群的独特结构实现高效的大整数加密。cgVSS简化了NI-VSS过程，相比现有方案有显著性能提升。文章还定义了公共可验证性，并扩展到即使所有接收者可能被攻击也能保持的强公共可验证性。通过通用转换，作者得到了一个基于类群的非交互式分布式密钥生成方案(cgDKG)，适用于阈值系统。安全分析考虑了公共可验证性对DKG的影响。总的来说，这篇论文展示了类群在构建高效、可验证的密码学协议中的潜力。 <div>
We put forward a non-interactive verifiable secret sharing (NI-VSS) scheme using class groups – we call it cgVSS. Our construction follows the standard framework of encrypting the shares to a set of recipients and generating a non-interactive proof of correct sharing. However, as opposed to prior works, such as Groth’s [Eprint 2021], or Gentry et al.’s [Eurocrypt 2022], we do not require any range proof - this is possible due to the unique structure of class groups, that enables efficient encryption/decryption of large field elements in the exponent of an ElGamal-style encryption scheme. Importantly, this is possible without destroying the additive holomorphic structure, which is required to make the proof-of-correctness highly efficient. This approach not only substantially simplifies the NI-VSS process, but also outperforms the state-of-art schemes significantly. For example, our implementation shows that for a 150 node system cgVSS outperforms (a simplified implementation of) Groth’s protocol in overall communication complexity by 5.6x, about 9.3 − 9.7x in the dealer time and 2.4 − 2.7x in the receiver time per node.

Additionally, we formalize the notion of public verifiability, which enables anyone, possibly outside the participants, to verify the correctness of the dealing. In fact, we re-interpret the notion of public verifiability and extend it to the setting when potentially all recipients may be corrupt and yet can not defy public verifiability – to distinguish from state-of-art, we call this strong public verifiability. Our formalization uses the universal composability framework.

Finally, through a generic transformation, we obtain a non-interactive distributed key generation (NI-DKG) scheme for threshold systems, where the secret key is the discrete log of the public key. Our security analysis in the VSS-hybrid model uses a formalization that considers a (strong) public verifiability notion for DKG, even when more than threshold parties are corrupt. Instantiating with cgVSS we obtain a NI-DKG scheme from class groups – we call it cgDKG.

总结:<br />
本文研究了无需可信设置和不使用公钥加密的异步拜占庭共识协议。提出了一种基于随机 oracle 的 Asynchronous Common Subset（ACS）协议，具有$O(\kappa n^3)$总通信量和$O(1)$期望轮数。该协议仅依赖于密码哈希函数，因此对量子攻击也安全。与现有实现相比，实验表明该协议更为高效。此外，文中还介绍了新引入的异步秘密密钥共享和覆盖聚集等概念，这些可能独立具有价值。 <div>
Byzantine consensus is a fundamental building block in distributed cryptographic problems. Despite decades of research, most existing asynchronous consensus protocols require a strong trusted setup and expensive public-key cryptography. In this paper, we study asynchronous Byzantine consensus protocols that do not rely on a trusted setup and do not use public-key cryptography such as digital signatures. We give an Asynchronous Common Subset (ACS) protocol whose security is only based on cryptographic hash functions modeled as a random oracle. Our protocol has $O(\kappa n^3)$ total communication and runs in expected $O(1)$ rounds. The fact that we use only cryptographic hash functions also means that our protocol is post-quantum secure. The minimal use of cryptography and the small number of rounds make our protocol practical. We implement our protocol and evaluate it in a geo-distributed setting with up to 128  machines. Our experimental evaluation shows that our protocol is more efficient than the only other setup-free consensus protocol that has been implemented to date. En route to our asynchronous consensus protocols, we also introduce new primitives called asynchronous secret key sharing and cover gather, which may be of independent interest.

总结:
本文探讨了随着生成式AI技术的发展，媒体真实性验证的需求增加。为确保图像来源的可信度，作者提出了一种名为VIMz的高效可验证图像操纵系统，它利用折叠式zkSNARKs技术降低证明者复杂性。与先前方法相比，VIMz在处理高清和4K图像时，实现了时间速度提升3倍，内存消耗减少96倍（从309GB降至3.2GB）。此外，文章还设计了一个无信任智能合约系统，用于自动验证媒体真实性的证明，支持版权和所有权的透明管理，符合内容可追溯性和真实性联盟（C2PA）标准。这一系统为构建去中心化的媒体市场奠定了基础，具有广泛的应用前景。 <div>
With the rise of generative AI technology, the media's credibility as a source of truth has been significantly compromised. This highlights the need to verify the authenticity of media and its originality.
Ensuring the integrity of media during capture using the device itself presents a straightforward solution to this challenge.
However, raw captured media often require certain refinements or redactions before publication. Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) offer a solution by allowing attestation of the correctness of specific transformations applied to an authorized image. While shown to be feasible, previous approaches faced challenges in practice due to their high prover complexity.

In this paper, we aim to develop a practical framework for efficiently proving the authenticity of HD and 4K images on commodity hardware. Our goal is to minimize prover complexity by utilizing the folding-based zkSNARKs technique, resulting in VIMz, the first practical verifiable image manipulation system of this kind. VIMz leverages Nova's folding scheme to achieve low complexity recursive zkSNARK proofs of authentic image manipulation. Our implementation results demonstrate a substantial reduction in prover complexity—up to a 3$\times$ speedup in time and a 96$\times$ reduction in memory (from 309 GB in [Kang et al., arXiv 2022] to only 3.2 GB). Moreover, the low memory consumption allows VIMz to prove the correctness of multiple chained transformations simultaneously, further increasing the performance (up to 3.5$\times$).
Additionally,
we propose a trustless smart contract system that autonomously verifies the proofs of media authenticity, achieving trustless copyright and ownership management, aligning with the standards of the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA).
Such a system serves as a foundational infrastructure for constructing trustless media marketplaces with diverse applications.

本文主要探讨了一种针对点、比较和区间函数的变体Function Secret Sharing (FSS)方案，旨在实现更紧凑的$p$- party（$p \geq 3$）密钥大小。相比于现有构造，该方案显著减少了DPF的密钥大小，降低了$2^p$倍，同时对非线性解码器进行了一次额外的比较操作。对于分布式比较函数，作者实现了史上最小的密钥大小，减少了一个$q^{p-1}$因子，对隐私保护机器学习（PPML）中的应用有实际意义。此外，文章还展示了如何将这种改进应用于神经网络的分布式实现，如分布式ReLU激活函数，证实了新方案的有效性。 <div>
We present a variant of Function Secret Sharing (FSS) schemes tailored for point, comparison, and interval functions, featuring compact key sizes at the expense of additional comparison. While existing FSS constructions are primarily geared towards $2$-party scenarios, exceptions such as the work by Boyle et al. (Eurocrypt 2015) and Riposte (S&amp;P 2015) have introduced FSS schemes for $p$-party scenarios ($p \geq 3$). This paper aims to achieve the most compact $p$-party FSS key size to date. We achieve a noteworthy reduction in key size, a $2^p$-factor decrease compared to state-of-the-art FSS constructions (including computationally efficient constructions using symmetric-key primitives) of distributed point function (DPF). Compared to the previous public-key-based FSS design for DPF, we also get a key size reduction equal to a $2^{n/2}$-sized row vector, where $2^n$ is the domain size of the point function. This reduction in key size comes at the cost of a required comparison operation by the decoder (hence called a non-linear decoder), a departure from prior schemes. In $p$-party scenarios, our construction outperforms existing FSS constructions in key size, remaining on par with Riposte in evaluation time and showing significant improvement over Boyle et al.

In addition to constructing FSS for distributed point functions (DPF), we extend our approach to distributed comparison and interval functions, achieving the most efficient key size to date. Our distributed comparison function exhibits a key-size reduction by a factor of $q^{p-1}$, where $q$ denotes the size of the algebraic group used in the scheme's construction.
The reduced key size of the comparison function has practical implications, particularly in applications like privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML), where thousands of comparison functions are employed in each neural network layer.
To demonstrate the effectiveness of our improvements, we design and prototype-implement a scalable privacy-preserving framework for neural networks over distributed models. Specifically, we implement a distributed rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function using our distributed comparison function, showcasing the efficacy of our proposed scheme.

<div> 关键词：分布式服务、多党计算（MPC）、身份-based加密、公开可验证、在线扑克。

总结: <br />
我们的文章介绍了一种分布式服务，用于为在线扑克玩家生成私密但可公开验证的关联随机性，如洗牌。该服务利用多党计算协议在离线阶段创建一个加密的卡片排列，确保其是卡片的唯一排列。当玩家加入时，他们仅需通过安全渠道获取身份特定的解密密钥并本地解密，简化了在线过程。文章的关键创新在于提出可缩简证明的多身份基加密（SVME），以及一种高效的小集合随机排列的秘密共享生成协议。整个系统在保证实时性和成本效益的同时，提供了信任最小化的在线扑克体验。在实验中，8个MPC参与者为64张牌生成可验证排列仅需3秒，而玩家获取牌只需0.3秒。 <div>
We develop a distributed service for generating correlated randomness (e.g. permutations) for multiple parties, where each party’s output is private but publicly verifiable. This service provides users with a low-cost way to play online poker in real-time, without a trusted party.
Our service is backed by a committee of compute providers, who run a multi-party computation (MPC) protocol to produce an (identity-based) encrypted permutation of a deck of cards, in an offline phase well ahead of when the players’ identities are known. When the players join, what we call the online phase, they decrypt their designated cards immediately after deriving the identity-based decryption keys, a much simpler computation. In addition, the MPC protocol also generates a publicly-verifiable proof that the output is a permutation.
In our construction, we introduce a new notion of succinctly verifiable multi-identity based encryption (SVME), which extends the existing notion of verifiable encryption to a multi-identity-based setting, but with a constant sized proof – this may be of independent interest. We instantiate this for a permutation relation (defined over a small set) along with identity-based encryption, polynomial commitments and succinct proofs – our choices are made to enable a distributed computation when the card deck is always secret shared. Moreover, we design a new protocol to efficiently generate a secret-sharing of random permutation of a small set, which is run prior to distributed SVME.
Running these protocols offline simplifies the online phase substantially, as parties only derive their identity-specific keys privately via secure channels with the MPC committee, and then decrypt locally to obtain their decks. We provide a rigorous UC-based formalization in a highly modularized fashion.
Finally, we demonstrate practicality with an implementation that shows that for 8 MPC parties, gen- erating a secret publicly-verifiable permutation of 64 cards takes under 3 seconds, while accessing cards for a player takes under 0.3 seconds.

<div> 关键词：Collaborative Graph Learning, Federated Learning, Secure Machine Learning, Graph Neural Networks, CoGNN.

总结:<br />
本文提出了一种新的框架CoGNN，它结合了联邦学习和安全机器学习在协作图学习中的优点。CoGNN通过一种新的消息传递机制和两阶段Dispatch-Collect执行方案，实现了对图神经网络（GNN）训练和推理的隐私保护、高效计算和可扩展性。实验表明，相比于最先进的安全机器学习方法，CoGNN在运行时间和通信成本上分别减少了123倍和522倍，同时保持了与全局图训练相近的模型精度，甚至在某些情况下提高了11.06%。总的来说，CoGNN为协作图学习提供了一个高效且安全的解决方案。 <div>
Collaborative graph learning represents a learning paradigm where multiple parties jointly train a graph neural network (GNN) using their own proprietary graph data. To honor the data privacy of all parties, existing solutions for collaborative graph learning are either based on federated learning (FL) or secure machine learning (SML). Although promising in terms of efficiency and scalability due to their distributed training scheme, FL-based approaches fall short in providing provable security guarantees and achieving good model performance. Conversely, SML-based solutions, while offering provable privacy guarantees, are hindered by their high computational and communication overhead, as well as poor scalability as more parties participate.

To address the above problem, we propose CoGNN, a novel framework that simultaneously reaps the benefits of both FL-based and SML-based approaches. At a high level, CoGNN is enabled by (i) a novel message passing mechanism that can obliviously and efficiently express the vertex data propagation/aggregation required in GNN training and inference and (ii) a two-stage Dispatch-Collect execution scheme to securely decompose and distribute the GNN computation workload for concurrent and scalable executions. We further instantiate the CoGNN framework, together with customized optimizations, to train Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) models. Extensive evaluations on three graph datasets demonstrate that compared with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) SML-based approach, CoGNN reduces up to $123$x running time and up to $522$x communication cost per party. Meanwhile, the GCN models trained using CoGNN have nearly identical accuracies as the plaintext global-graph training, yielding up to $11.06\%$ accuracy improvement over the GCN models trained via federated learning.

<title>Adaptor Signatures: New Security Definition and A Generic Construction for NP Relations</title>

<div> 关键词：Adaptor Signatures (AS), Witness Hiding, NP relation, One-way Functions, Trapdoor Commitments.

总结:
本文主要探讨了适应性签名(Adaptor Signatures, AS)及其增强的安全特性——隐藏见证。AS最初允许签名者为硬关系实例生成预签名，但早期构造存在缺陷，预签名关联的见证会暴露。为解决这个问题，作者提出了一种新的定义，即“见证隐藏”，并证明在仅依赖单向函数假设下，可以构建AS，满足这一安全属性。文章还提出了一种基于签名和弱型陷阱门承诺（特定可适应消息的陷阱门承诺）的通用构造，通过实例化基于汉密尔顿回路问题，扩展到任何NP关系。这一工作为AS的应用，特别是在区块链等场景，提供了更安全的解决方案。 <div>
An adaptor signatures (AS) scheme is an extension of digital signatures that allows the signer to generate a pre-signature for an instance of a hard relation. This pre-signature can later be adapted to a full signature with a corresponding witness. Meanwhile, the signer can extract a witness from both the pre-signature and the signature. AS have recently garnered more attention due to its scalability and interoperability. Dai et al. [INDOCRYPT 2022] proved that AS can be constructed for any NP relation using a generic construction. However, their construction has a shortcoming: the associated witness is exposed by the adapted signature. This flaw poses limits the applications of AS, even in its motivating setting, i.e., blockchain, where the adapted signature is typically uploaded to the blockchain and is public to everyone.

To address this issue, in this work we augment the security definition of AS by a natural property which we call witness hiding. We then prove the existence of AS for any NP relation, assuming the existence of one-way functions. Concretely, we propose a generic construction of witness-hiding AS from signatures and a weak variant of trapdoor commitments, which we term trapdoor commitments with a specific adaptable message. We instantiate the latter based on the Hamiltonian cycle problem. Since the Hamiltonian cycle problem is NP-complete, we can obtain witness hiding adaptor signatures for any NP relation.

<div> 关键词：sequential functions, one-way functions, oracle separation, continuous iterative sequential functions (CISF), fine-grained cryptography

总结:<br />
这篇文章主要探讨了序列函数（sequential functions）的理论复杂性和其与单向函数的关系。作者展示了存在一个黑盒Oracle，它能证明序列函数的存在但不能证明单向函数的存在，这与通常的构造方式形成对比。文章还深入研究了连续迭代序列函数（CISF）的决策性最坏情况问题，证明其是PSPACE-完全的。此外，通过仅假设非单向CISF，构建了“细粒度”加密和MAC等安全协议。最后，文中定义了称为交换式序列函数的新概念，它可用于实现细粒度密钥交换。这些结果揭示了序列函数在密码学中的潜在应用，即使在不依赖单向函数的情况下。 <div>
A sequential function is, informally speaking, a function $f$ for which a massively parallel adversary cannot compute "substantially" faster than an honest user with limited parallel computation power. Sequential functions form the backbone of many primitives that are extensively used in blockchains such as verifiable delay functions (VDFs) and time-lock puzzles. Despite this widespread practical use, there has been little work studying the complexity or theory of sequential functions.

Our main result is a black-box oracle separation between sequential functions and one-way functions: in particular, we show the existence of an oracle $\mathcal{O}$ that implies a sequential function but not a one-way function. This seems surprising since sequential functions are typically constructed from very strong assumptions that imply one-way functions and also since time-lock puzzles are known to imply one-way functions (Bitansky et al., ITCS '16).

We continue our exploration of the theory of sequential functions. We show that, informally speaking, the decisional, worst-case variant of a certain class of sequential function called a continuous iterative sequential function (CISF) is PSPACE-complete. A CISF is, in a nutshell, a sequential function $f$ that can be written in the form $f \left(k, x \right) = g^{k} \left(x \right)$ for some function $g$ where $k$ is an input determining the number of "rounds" the function is evaluated. We then show that more general forms of sequential functions are not contained in PSPACE relative to a random oracle.

Given these results, we then ask if it is possible to build any interesting cryptographic primitives from sequential functions that are not one-way. It turns out that even if we assume just the existence of a CISF that is not one-way, we can build certain "fine-grained" cryptographic primitives where security is defined similarly to traditional primitives with the exception that it is only guaranteed for some (generally polynomial) amount of time. In particular, we show how to build "fine-grained" symmetric key encryption and "fine-grained" MACs from a CISF. We also show how to build fine-grained public-key encryption from a VDF with a few extra natural properties and indistinguishability obfucsation (iO) for null circuits. We do not assume one-way functions. Finally, we define a primitive that we call a commutative sequential function - essentially a sequential function that can be computed in sequence to get the same output in two different ways - and show that it implies fine-grained key exchange.

<div> 关键词：threshold secret sharing, reconstruction time, ramp secret sharing, adaptive corruptions, distributed generation

总结:<br />
该论文研究了改进的阈值秘密共享方案，特别关注减少消息重建时间。提出了一种新型的$(t,c)$-ramp秘密分享方案，对于高阈值$t$（如$2^{20}$），其重建时间比现有方法快2-7.8倍，从$t=256$开始就有明显改善。新方案基于Cramer等人的框架和Applebaum等人的工作，利用随机带状矩阵构建高效且适应适应性攻击的错误纠正代码。应用上，该技术可降低联邦学习中安全聚合协议的计算成本，同时提供更快的可验证ramp秘密共享和分布式可验证随机函数。总的来说，这项工作显著提升了阈值秘密共享的效率和实用性。 <div>
Threshold secret sharing enables distributing a message to $n$ parties such that no subset of fewer than $t$ parties can learn the message, whereas any subset of at least $t$ parties can recover the message. Despite being a fundamental primitive, secret sharing still suffers from one significant drawback, where its message reconstruction algorithm is computationally expensive for large privacy thresholds $t$. In this paper, we aim to address this significant drawback.

We study general $(t,c)$-ramp secret sharing schemes where the number of parties c needed to reconstruct the secret may be larger than $t$. We present a ramp secret sharing scheme whose reconstruction time is 2-7.8x faster than prior constructions suitable against adversaries that adaptively corrupt parties. For $t = 2^{20}$, our new protocol has reconstruction time of 5 seconds whereas prior work requires nearly half a minute. We see improvements starting from as small as $t = 256$. Furthermore, we obtain correctness threshold as small as $c \ge 1.05t$. To obtain our construction, we first improve the secret sharing frameworks by Cramer et al. (EUROCRYPT'15) and Applebaum et al. (CRYPTO'23) from erasure codes. Our new framework obtains secret sharing schemes that may be used against adversaries with adaptive corruptions while requiring only weaker correctness guarantees from the underlying erasure code with a distributed generation property. Furthermore, our new framework also maintains the linear homomorphism of the prior works. Afterwards, we present a concretely efficient erasure code from random band matrices that satisfies the distributed generation property.

We show that our secret sharing scheme can improve many real-world applications. In secure aggregation protocols for federated learning, we obtain up to 22% reductions in computational cost by replacing Shamir's scheme with our construction. We extend our protocol to obtain a verifiable ramp secret sharing scheme where each party can verify the consistency of the shares. Our new verifiable ramp secret sharing has 8.2-25.2x faster sharing and 2.7-23.2x faster reconstruction time compared to prior works. Finally, we present an improved distributed verifiable random function that may be used for decentralized randomness beacons.

<title>Byzantine Fault Tolerance with Non-Determinism, Revisited</title>

<div> 关键词：Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT), non-determinism, Block-ND, multivalued Byzantine agreement (MBA), asynchronous setting

总结:
这篇文章主要关注在非确定性环境下改进拜占庭容错（BFT）算法。作者提出了一种新的设计Block-ND，它将交易顺序的共识和状态共识分离，允许在现有的BFT实现基础上进行扩展。Block-ND通过将状态共识降级为多值拜占庭协议（MBA）来处理非确定性，尽管MBA在实践系统中被忽视。文章提供了一个比现有方案更快的MBA构造，并在部分同步和纯异步环境中实现了Block-ND。实验结果显示，Block-ND在91个节点的广域网部署中，其性能损失相对较小，与传统BFT相比具有更好的适应性。 <div>
The conventional Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) paradigm requires replicated state machines to execute deterministic operations only. In practice, numerous applications and scenarios, especially in the era of blockchains, contain various sources of non-determinism. Despite decades of research on BFT, we still lack an efficient and easy-to-deploy solution for BFT with non-determinism—BFT-ND, especially in the asynchronous setting.
We revisit the problem of BFT-ND and provide a formal and asynchronous treatment of BFT-ND. In particular, we design and implement Block-ND that insightfully separates the task of agreeing on the order of transactions from the task of agreement on the state: Block-ND allows reusing existing BFT implementations; on top of BFT, we reduce the agreement on the state to multivalued Byzantine agreement (MBA), a somewhat neglected primitive by practical systems. Block-ND is completely asynchronous as long as the underlying BFT is asynchronous.
We provide a new MBA construction significantly faster than existing MBA constructions. We instantiate Block-ND in both the partially synchronous setting (with PBFT, OSDI 1999) and the purely asynchronous setting (with PACE, CCS 2022). Via a 91-instance WAN deployment on Amazon EC2, we show that Block-ND has only marginal performance degradation compared to conventional BFT.

<div> 关键词：self-sovereign identity (SSI), CanDID, privacy-preserving, attribute-based threshold anonymous counting tokens (tACT), Sybil-resistant

总结:<br />
本文探讨了自我主权身份（SSI）系统中的挑战，特别是CanDID方案的局限性。作者提出了可公开验证的属性基阈值匿名计数令牌（tACT），这是一种分布式信任环境下的创新解决方案，旨在增强匿名性和减少用户与发行者交互。tACT通过支持阈值发行、多显示选择性披露和非交互式非转移凭证，构建了一个高效的Sybil攻击抵抗的SSI系统。这个新系统在效率上优于CanDID，支持更多发行者，并实现了一轮并行协议，显著提升了用户隐私和控制性。 <div>
Self-sovereign identity (SSI) systems empower users to (anonymously) establish and verify their identity when accessing both digital and real-world resources, emerging as a promising privacy-preserving solution for user-centric identity management. Recent work by Maram et al. proposes the privacy-preserving Sybil-resistant decentralized SSI system CanDID (IEEE S&amp;P 2021). While this is an important step, notable shortcomings undermine its efficacy. The two most significant among them being the following: First, unlinkability breaks in the presence of a single malicious issuer. Second, it introduces interactiveness, as the users are required to communicate each time with issuers to collect credentials intended for use in interactions with applications. This contradicts the goal of SSI, whose aim is to give users full control over their identities. This paper first introduces the concept of publicly verifiable attribute-based threshold anonymous counting tokens (tACT). Unlike recent approaches confined to centralized settings (Benhamouda et al., ASIACRYPT 2023), tACT operates in a distributed-trust environment. Accompanied by a formal security model and a provably secure instantiation, tACT introduces a novel dimension to token issuance, which, we believe, holds independent interest. Next, the paper leverages the proposed tACT scheme to construct an efficient Sybil-resistant SSI system. This system supports various functionalities, including threshold issuance, unlinkable multi-show selective disclosure, and non-interactive, non-transferable credentials that offer constant-size credentials. Finally, our benchmark results show an efficiency improvement in our construction when compared to CanDID all while accommodating a greater number of issuers and additionally reducing to a one-round protocol that can be run in parallel with all issuers.

<div> 关键词：Nakamoto共识、Proof-of-Work（PoW）、Proof-of-Stake（PoS）、block production rate、security-performance tradeoff。

总结:<br />
Nakamoto共识协议在有限资源网络中的安全性与性能之间存在经典问题。传统分析忽视了节点处理块的速率限制导致的拥堵。本文提出新的分析方法，揭示了在带宽受限模型中，与经典模型不同，私人攻击不再是最糟情况，而一种名为“逗弄策略”的新攻击更糟。对于PoS，equivocation会加剧拥堵，使得传统PoS NC在高生产率下不安全。为此，作者提出Blanking NC（BlaNC），它能提供与PoW NC相同的抗攻击性，同时解决拥堵问题。 <div>
For Nakamoto's longest-chain consensus protocol, whose proof-of-work (PoW) and proof-of-stake (PoS) variants power major blockchains such as Bitcoin and Cardano, we revisit the classic problem of the security--performance tradeoff: Given a network of nodes with finite communication- and computation-resources, against what fraction of adversary power is Nakamoto consensus (NC) secure for a given block production rate? State-of-the-art analyses of NC fail to answer this question, because their bounded-delay model does not capture the rate limits to nodes' processing of blocks, which cause congestion when blocks are released in quick succession. We develop a new analysis technique to prove a refined security--performance tradeoff for PoW NC in a bounded-capacity model. In this model, we show that, in contrast to the classic bounded-delay model, Nakamoto's private attack is no longer the worst attack, and a new attack we call the teasing strategy, that exploits congestion, is strictly worse. In PoS, equivocating blocks can exacerbate congestion, making traditional PoS NC insecure except at very low block production rates. To counter such equivocation spamming, we present a variant of PoS NC we call Blanking NC (BlaNC), which achieves the same resilience as PoW NC.

<div> 关键词：Proof-of-Work（PoW）、Directed Acyclic Graphs（DAGs）、Congestible Blockchain Model（CBM）、Late-Predecessor Attack、Prism、OHIE。

总结:
这篇文章探讨了基于DAG的PoW区块链协议在高吞吐量环境下的安全性和性能。通过引入CBM模型，研究者分析了同时存在的块和复杂依赖如何影响延迟。他们设计了一种攻击策略——late-predecessor攻击，利用块间的依赖延迟诚实块的处理。针对Prism和OHIE两个旨在打破安全性能权衡的协议，研究发现它们在高吞吐量下会面临降级的安全性以及延长的延迟，这类似于传统的链式协议。 <div>
Proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain protocols based on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) have demonstrated superior transaction confirmation performance compared to their chain-based predecessors. However, it is uncertain whether their security deteriorates in high-throughput settings similar to their predecessors, because their acceptance of simultaneous blocks and complex block dependencies presents challenges for rigorous security analysis.

We address these challenges by analyzing DAG-based protocols via a congestible blockchain model (CBM), a general model that allows case-by-case upper bounds on the block propagation delay, rather than a uniform upper bound as in most previous analyses. CBM allows us to capture two key phenomena of high-throughput settings: (1) simultaneous blocks increase each other's propagation delay, and (2) a block can be processed only after receiving all the blocks it refers to. We further devise a reasonable adversarial block propagation strategy in CBM, called the late-predecessor attack, which exploits block dependencies to delay the processing of honest blocks. We then evaluate the security and performance of Prism and OHIE, two DAG-based protocols that aim to break the security-performance tradeoff, in the presence of an attacker capable of launching the late predecessor attack. Our results show that these protocols suffer from reduced security and extended latency in high-throughput settings similar to their chain-based predecessors.
