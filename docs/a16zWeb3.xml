<p>with @atabarrok @skominers @smc90</p><p>We've heard a lot about the premise and the promise of prediction markets for a long time, but they finally hit the main stage with the most recent election. So what worked (and didn't) this time? Are they really better than pollsters, is polling dead? </p><p>So in this conversation, we tease apart the hype from the reality of prediction markets, from the recent election to market foundations... going more deeply into the how, why, and where these markets work. We also discuss the design challenges and opportunities (including implications for builders throughout). And we also cover other information aggregation mechanisms -- from peer prediction to others -- given that prediction markets are part of a broader category of information-elicitation and information-aggregation mechanisms. <br /><br />Where do domain experts, superforecasters, pollsters, and journalists come in (and out)? Where do (and don't) blockchain and crypto technologies come in -- and what specific features (decentralization, transparency, real-time, open source, etc.) matter most, and in what contexts?  Finally, we discuss applications for prediction and decision markets -- things we could do right away to in the near-future to sci-fi -- touching on trends like futarchy, AI entering the market, DeSci, and more.  </p><p>Our special expert guests are Alex Taborrok, professor of economics at George Mason University and Chair in Economics at the Mercatus Center; and Scott Duke Kominers, research partner at a16z crypto, and professor at Harvard Business School  -- both in conversation with Sonal Chokshi. </p><p>As a reminder: None of the following should be taken as business, investment, legal, or tax advice; please see a16z.com/disclosures for more important information. </p><p><strong>RESOURCES</strong><br /><strong>(from links to research mentioned to more on the topics discussed)</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.econlib.org/library/Essays/hykKnw.html" target="_blank">The Use of Knowledge in Society</a> by Friedrich Hayek (American Economic Review, 1945)</li><li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eberem/everything_is_priced_in/" target="_blank">Everything is priced in</a> by rsd99 (r/wallstreetbets, 2019)</li><li><a href="https://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/ideafutures.html" target="_blank">Idea Futures (aka prediction markets, information markets)</a> by Robin Hanson (1996)</li><li><a href="https://www.ucpress.edu/books/auctions/paper" target="_blank">Auctions: The Social Construction of Value</a>  by Charles Smith</li><li><a href="https://people.duke.edu/~qc2/BA532/2002%20AER%20Morris%20and%20Shin.pdf" target="_blank">Social value of public information</a> by Stephen Morris and Hyun Song Shin (American Economic Review, December 2002)</li><li><a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1516179112" target="_blank">Using prediction markets to estimate the reproducibility of scientific research</a> by Anna Dreber, Thomas Pfeiffer, Johan Almenberg, Siri Isaksson, Brad Wilson, Yiling Chen, Brian Nosek, and Magnus Johannesson (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (November 2015)</li><li><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature21054" target="_blank">A solution to the single-question crowd wisdom problem</a> by Dražen Prelec, Sebastian Seung, and John McCoy (Nature, January 2017)</li><li><a href="https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/Targeting_Entrepreneurs_AER2022_64933cef-316a-437f-8ca4-885d870b2ba1.pdf" target="_blank">Targeting high ability entrepreneurs using community information: Mechanism design in the field</a> by Reshmaan Hussam, Natalia Rigol, and Benjamin Roth (American Economic Review, March 2022)</li><li><a href="https://www.eecs.harvard.edu/cs286r/courses/fall12/papers/ms020408.pdf" target="_blank">Information aggregation mechanisms: concept, design, and implementation for a sales forecasting problem</a> by Charles Plott and Kay-Yut Chen, Hewlett Packard Laboratories (March 2002)</li><li><a href="https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/if-i-had-a-millhtml" target="_blank">If I had a million</a> [on deciding to dump the CEO or not] by Robin Hanson (2008)</li><li><a href="https://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/futarchy.html" target="_blank">Futarchy: Vote values, but bet beliefs</a> by Robin Hanson (2013)</li><li><a href="https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2024/11/09/infofinance.html" target="_blank">From prediction markets to info finance</a> by Vitalik Buterin (November 2024)</li><li><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/how-composability-unlocks-crypto-and-everything-else/" target="_blank">Composability is innovation</a> by Linda Xie (June 2021)</li><li><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/composability-is-to-software-as-compounding-interest-is-to-finance/" target="_blank">Composability is to software as compounding interest is to finance</a> by Chris Dixon (October 2021)</li><li><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/tags/daos/" target="_blank">resources & research on DAOs</a>, a16z crypto <br /> </li></ul>

<p><i>with @ahall_research @eddylazzarin @0xShuel  @smc90</i></p><p>In this episode, we cover both recent events + evergreen governance questions in political systems: Specifically, we breakdown the recent Compound “governance attack”... as well as the broader topic of DAO governance and voting in general. We also discuss how to avoid, prevent, and respond to such governance attacks -- highlighting key differences between on-chain/ token-based/ digital voting systems vs. physical-world political systems around the world. </p><p>What happens when you have activity from actors that the majority doesn’t necessarily agree with?

<div> 关键词：创新生态系统、伦敦、科技人才、风险与收益、国际合作

总结:

在这次特别节目中，我们深入探讨了区域创新的概念，从系统层面和个体层面出发。我们分析了哪些因素能够使特定地区成为创新和经济增长的中心（即所谓的“创新生态系统”），同时也讨论了在结构和个人层面上，是什么造就了创业人才、投资人才以及雄心壮志、追求和找到正确道路的心态。我们还广泛地讨论了如何在不同地区，如伦敦和欧洲，管理风险与回报和动态性。

我们的嘉宾，与《a16z》主编Sonal Chokshi进行了对话，后者也邀请他参加了《a16z》在英国的首次巡展。这位嘉宾在伦敦的创业和技术生态系统中扮演了重要角色，他是A16Z（与Alice Bentinck共同创立）的主席，同时也是英国先进研究与发明机构（ARIA）的主席。在节目录制之前，他还担任了英国首相的代表，负责组织在Bletchley Park（英国计算历史的标志性地点）举行的AI安全峰会。在节目录制之后不久，他被英国科学部长任命为“AI机会行动计划”的执行人，以向英国政府提出建议。

这次访谈是在伦敦安德森霍洛威茨的第一个国际办公室进行的，对于更多关于我们在这里的努力和其他相关内容，请访问a16zcrypto.com/uk。需要提醒的是，节目中的内容不应被视为投资、法律、商业或税务建议；更多信息和链接，请参阅a16z.com/disclosures。 <div>

<div> 关键词: a16z, crypto, Sonal Chokshi, reading, books

总结: 在这次走廊式对话中，a16z加密团队的Sonal Chokshi、Robert Hackett、Tim Sullivan和Stephanie Zinn讨论了他们最新的年度阅读选择，以及那些反复出现在清单上的经典作品。他们探讨了阅读方式的多样性，包括有声书、图形小说和集体推荐的价值。对话还涉及书籍改编为电影、电视和游戏的比较，以及现代文学类型如“信息娱乐”和“奇幻浪漫”的兴起。他们反思阅读的目的，从神话到现代文化，表达了对阅读的热爱和好奇的魅力。总的来说，这是一场关于书籍与阅读的欢乐旅程，体现了a16z加密团队和Andreessen Horowitz的编辑视角。 <div>
<p>with @rhhackett @smc90 @stephbzinn @tim_org</p><p>In this fun hallway-style conversation, a16z crypto's Sonal Chokshi, Robert Hackett, Tim Sullivan, and Stephanie Zinn discusses picks from our latest annual <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/book-recommendation-reading-list-summer-2024/" target="_blank">summer reading list</a>, as well as evergreen/ Lindy picks that show up on our <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/?tag=what-were-reading" target="_blank">what-we're-reading lists</a> again and again. We also share our top picks of all time. </p><p>Throughout, we also discuss HOW we read -- whether audiobooks counts as reading or listening, graphic novels, read-alouds; on  multiple modes of reading; and technologies for reading and how they have changed us over time. Which books are better as movies and TV shows, and games too? Also, are collaboratively-filtered recommendations via family or friends really that great? What other heuristics -- and anti-heuristics! -- do we use to read? </p><p>Finally, WHY we do read?? Is mythology and fantasy filling a hole left by religion? Wherefore nonfiction vs. fiction... or seemingly new genres such as "infotainment", "romantasy", and others?  From Shakespeare to Prince Harry to erstwhile seafarers to modern mermaids, this episode is a rollicking ride -- and love letter -- to all things books, and reading, from the a16z crypto editorial team and Andreessen Horowitz.  Curiosity is magic, after all!</p>

<div> 关键词：技术、艺术、艺术家、新兴平台、NFTs。

总结:<br />这篇文章讨论了技术如何深刻影响艺术，以及艺术家如何随着科技发展而创新。从早期的洞穴壁画到现代的数字艺术，如Web浏览器、iPhone、Instagram和区块链上的生成艺术，包括NFTs，都展示了艺术形式的演变。艺术家们不仅实验新的创作工具，也探索艺术与商业、主流与边缘的界限。同时，文章提到科技产物（如NSA图纸）也被视为艺术的一部分，反映了对乐观主义和新视角的追求。最后，要注意的是，文中提及的内容不构成投资、法律或税务建议。 <div>
<p>with @dennnnnnnnny @smc90</p><p>We know that technology has changed art, and that artists have evolved with every new technology — it’s a tale as old as humanity, moving from cave paintings to computers. Underlying these movements are endless debates around inventing versus remixing; between commercialism and art; between mainstream canon and fringe art; whether we’re living in an artistic monoculture now (the answer may surprise you); and much much more. </p><p>So in this new episode featuring Berlin-based contemporary artist <a href="https://twitter.com/dennnnnnnnny?lang=en" target="_blank">Simon Denny</a> -- in conversation with a16z crypto editor in chief Sonal Chokshi -- we discuss all of the above debates. We also cover how artists experimented with the emergence of new technology platforms like the web browser, the iPhone, Instagram and social media; to how generative art found its “native” medium on blockchains, why NFTs; and other art movements. </p><p>Denny also thinks of entrepreneurial ideas -- from Peter Thiel's to Chris Dixon's <i>Read Write Own</i> -- as an "aesthetic"; and thinks of technology artifacts (like NSA sketches!) as art -- reflecting all of these in his works across various mediums and contexts. How has technology changed art, and more importantly, how have artists changed with technology? How does art change our place in the world, or span beyond space? It's about optimism, and seeing things anew... all this and more in this episode.<br /><br /><i>As a reminder: none of this is investment, business, legal, or tax advice; please see a16z.com/disclosures for more important information, including a link to a list of our investments. </i><br /><br />SHOW NOTES:<br /><br /> </p>

<p><i>Welcome back to web3 with a16z -- a show about building the next generation of the internet, from the team at a16z crypto. This show is for anyone -- whether company leader or other entrepreneur, creator or developer, media or policymaker -- seeking to understand, and go deeper on all things blockchains, crypto, and web3. We’re back with all new episodes this season, beginning with some conversations that took place at our recent Founders Summit. </i></p><p>Today's guest is Jonathan Dotan, tech founder, <i>Emmy</i>-nominated producer, and writer who spent six seasons on HBO's show <i>Silicon Valley</i>. He is also the founding director of <a href="https://www.starlinglab.org/" target="_blank">The Starling Lab</a> for Data Integrity at Stanford & USC -- which prototypes tools and principles to bring historians, legal experts, and journalists into the new era of web3 -- and where he leads applied research on the decentralized web and human rights.  </p><p>This episode is based on a conversation that took place at our recent second annual Founders Summit -- with a16z crypto's Robert Hackett (also former senior writer at Fortune) -- in which they discuss how cryptographic technologies can help establish "ground truth" in conflict zones; the history of open source regulation; and more. </p><p>Dotan is also a fellow at Stanford’s Center for Blockchain Research and a lecturer at Stanford’s Department of Electrical Engineering and Graduate School of Business. This talk was preceded by a <a href="https://youtu.be/iDkUlpHQ4kM?si=TnKfSxvqygPLkerH." target="_blank">short presentation</a> from Dotan on the "enduring promise of web3" delivered at our second annual a16z crypto Founder Summit in November 2023, which you can watch <a href="https://youtu.be/iDkUlpHQ4kM?si=TnKfSxvqygPLkerH." target="_blank">on YouTube</a>. <br /> </p><p><i>As a reminder, none of the following should be taken as business, legal, tax, or investment advice; please see a16z.com/disclosures for more important information, including a link to a list of our investments.</i></p>

总结:<br />
在加密、技术行业、开放源代码社区以及分布式组织中，有效的沟通至关重要。如何清晰地传达信息，处理不同类型的受众，包括远程和现场参与者，以及新旧成员，是关键挑战。在这个Web3与a16z的特别节目里，作者Matt Abrahams分享了策略和技巧，如区分正式和非正式交流、结构的重要性、倾听的艺术，以及为领导者和个体贡献者设计的各种沟通模板。他认为，找到沟通中的“共同点”对于协作和未来工作至关重要，尤其是在加密领域，技术背后是人类的连接和合作。节目中还提醒听众，这不构成投资建议，需查看相关链接获取更多信息。 <div>
<p>with @smc90 @stanfordgsb </p><p>How does one *communicate* well -- especially in crypto, but also in other technical industries or open source communities? Or in distributed, decentralized organizations, where you may have participants that are both remote and in person, or a mix of regulars and newcomers/ strangers.  (Take for instance a community call to discuss technical or governance changes.) </p><p>How do you present information to different types of stakeholders; speak spontaneously; or resolve and recover from conflicts on the spot? So in this special book-launch episode of web3 with a16z, we invited  <a href="https://nofreakingspeaking.com/" target="_blank">Matt Abrahams</a> -- author of the <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Think-Faster-Talk-Smarter/Matt-Abrahams/9781668010303" target="_blank">new, just-released book</a>, <i>Think Faster, Talk Smarter: How to Speak Successfully When You're Put on the Spot</i> (he also hosts a popular podcast by a similar name, “Think Fast Talk Smart”, which you should also subscribe to!). Matt is not only a lecturer at the <a href="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/faculty/matt-forrest-abrahams" target="_blank">Stanford Graduate School of Business</a>, but he works with lots of companies and leaders on strategic communication, persuasive communication, interpersonal communication, and much more.</p><p>In this episode, Matt covers --  in conversation with host Sonal Chokshi -- specific templates, tactics, and tools that anyone can use; but we begin the first 15 minutes setting some foundational context, including the difference between informal vs. formal communication; why structure matters and how it relates to "spontaneity";  the art of listening with pace, space, and grace (for listening to oneself, too). We then cover several types of structures that anyone -- whether leader or individual contributor, engineer, marketing, sales -- can use in many types of communication. </p><p>Ultimately, crypto isn't just about technology and code -- but about open source, decentralization, collaboration -- people coordinating with each other at unprecedented scale: a very human thing. That's why finding the "common" in communication is essential, and represents the future of work, now. </p><p><i>resources referenced in this episode:</i></p><ul><li><a href="https://future.com/podcasts/moderation-communication-skills-mediums-virtual/" target="_blank">How to Moderate Talks, Panels, Meetings, and More (Virtual and Beyond!)</a>, a16z Podcast, November 2020 -- with Matt Abrahams and Sonal Chokshi</li><li><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/podcast/ethereum-merge-and-beyond/" target="_blank">Ethereum, Merge and Beyond, web3 with a16z podcast, September 2022</a> -- with Tim Beiko et al</li></ul><p><i>None of the following should be taken as investment, legal, business, or tax advice.

总结:<br />
在加密货币和Web3领域，选择合适的区块链对开发者至关重要。本文讨论了如何在快速变化和技术不断发展的背景下做出决定，涉及技术规格、社区支持、安全性、编程语言等多方面因素。a16z的Guy Wuollet和Eddy Lazzarin与主持人Sonal Chokshi一起梳理了区块链的整体景观，提供了框架来评估不同链的优缺点，包括对比分析和注意事项。这些建议并非投资或法律建议，提醒听众a16z可能有相关投资，并链接到更多资源。 <div>
<p>with @guywuolletjr @eddylazzarin @smc90<br /><br />"Which blockchain should I build in?" Is a very top of mind question for builders in web3, including  for people coming into the space for the first time -- but also relevant to anyone interested in tech innovation, tech stacks, and the evolution of infrastructure. So how does one decide among all the chain choices out there, particularly given how fast-moving the crypto and web3 space is? Things are constantly changing, things are still being built, and there's no one size fits all answer...</p><p>So in this episode, we -- a16z crypto’s Guy Wuollet, and CTO Eddy Lazzarin, in conversation with host Sonal Chokshi -- tease apart all the tangled threads and nuances of the topic. In the first third of the discussion, we sketch out the overall landscape, why it matters, quick definitions. Then, we focus on common/ frequently asked questions, specific tradeoffs, and a framework for deciding which chain -- including discussing different technical specs, as well as other dimensions such as: community, marketing & ecosystem support, security, custody, programming languages, and much, much more.<br /> </p><p>resources related to or mentioned in this episode:</p><ul><li><a href="https://web3-with-a16z.simplecast.com/episodes/programming-languages-smart-contract-programming-evolutions" target="_blank">Programming Languages & Crypto</a> (2023) with Sam Blackshear, Eddy Lazzarin, Noah Citron, Sonal Chokshi</li><li><a href="https://a16z.com/the-four-horsemen-of-centralization/" target="_blank">The Four Horsemen of Centralization</a> (2018) by Ali Yahya</li><li><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/web3-decentralization-models-framework-principles-how-to/" target="_blank">Decentralization for web3 Builders: Principles, Models, How</a> (2022) by Miles Jennings</li><li><a href="https://future.com/podcasts/network-effects-increasing-returns-trends/" target="_blank">Network Effects, Origin Stories, and the Evolution of Tech</a> (2018), with Brian Arthur, Marc Andreessen, and Sonal Chokshi  [see also <a href="https://hbr.org/1996/07/increasing-returns-and-the-new-world-of-business" target="_blank">this paper</a> referenced]</li></ul><p><i>None of the following should be taken as investment, legal, business, or tax advice.

<p>with @alive_eth @danboneh @smc90</p><p>This week's all-new episode covers the convergence of two important, very top-of-mind trends: AI (artificial intelligence) & blockchains/ crypto. These domains together have major implications for how we all live our lives everyday; so this episode is for anyone just curious about, or already building in the space. </p><p>The conversation covers topics ranging from deep fakes, bots, and the need for proof-of-humanity in a world of AI; to big data, large language models like ChatGPT, user control, governance, privacy and security, zero knowledge and zkML; to MEV, media, art, and much more. Our expert guests (in conversation with host Sonal Chokshi) include: </p><ul><li>Dan Boneh, Stanford Professor (and Senior Research Advisor at a16z crypto), a cryptographer who’s been working on blockchains for over a decade and who specializes in cryptography, computer security, and machine learning -- all of which intersect in this episode;</li><li>Ali Yahya, general partner at a16z crypto, who also previously worked at Google -- where he not only worked on a distributed system for a fleet of robots (a sort of "collective reinforcement learning") but also worked on Google Brain, where he was one of the core contributors to the machine learning library TensorFlow built at Google.</li></ul><p>The first half of the hallway-style conversation between Ali & Dan (who go back together as student and professor at Stanford) is all about how AI could benefit from crypto, and the second half on how crypto could benefit from AI... the thread throughout is the tension between centralization vs. decentralization.  So we also discuss where the intersection of crypto and AI can bring about things that aren't possible by either one of them alone...</p><p><i>pieces referenced in this episode/ related reading:</i></p><ul><li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.06616.pdf" target="_blank">The Next Cyber Reasoning System for Cyber Security</a> (2023) by Mohamed Ferrag, Ammar Battah, Norbert Tihanyi, Merouane Debbah, Thierry Lestable, Lucas Cordeiro</li><li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14752.pdf" target="_blank">A New Era in Software Security: Towards Self-Healing Software via Large Language Models and Formal Verification</a> (2023) by  Yiannis Charalambous, Norbert Tihanyi, Ridhi Jain, Youcheng Sun, Mohamed Ferrag, Lucas Cordeiro</li><li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.01215.pdf" target="_blank">Fixing Hardware Security Bugs with Large Language Models</a> (2023) by Baleegh Ahmad, Shailja Thakur, Benjamin Tan, Ramesh Karri, Hammond Pearce</li><li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03622" target="_blank">Do Users Write More Insecure Code with AI Assistants?</a> (2022) by Neil Perry, Megha Srivastava, Deepak Kumar, Dan Boneh</li><li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.09293" target="_blank">Asleep at the Keyboard?

<p>with @mg_486662 @riyazdf @nassyweazy and @smc90</p><p>This week’s all-new episode digs into recent high-profile hacks that took place in the crypto space over the last week -- we not only dig into what happened, including a more technical breakdown of the how and how we know -- but also cover the categories and issues specific to (and not specific to!) web3 security; as well as solutions and advice for builders.</p><p>We also touch on related trends and topics such as the role of open source; communications around hacks, as well as social media status signaling; and much more. Throughout, we try to help tease apart what’s hype/ what’s real, as well as the signal vs. the noise, in the narratives out there...  </p><p>Joining host Sonal Chokshi this week are experts from the a16z crypto security team, including: security engineer Matt Gleason; CTO Riyaz Faizullabhoy; and CISO Nassim Eddequiouaq -- both of whom previously worked at Facebook, Anchorage, and Docker [Nass also appeared on an earlier episode of this show, <a href="https://web3-with-a16z.simplecast.com/episodes/nfts-security-metadata-myths-dynamic-nfts-token-gated-experiences-0eWR1F5D" target="_blank">on evolving NFTs & security, available here</a>].</p><p>But for this episode, just to quickly recap for your context, the hacks we’re specifically covering are:</p><ul><li>The hack of the Nomad bridge -- which connects several different blockchains including Avalanche, Ethereum, Evmos, Moonbeam, and others – with reported range of between $185-$190M stolen; </li><li>The hack of the Slope wallet -- a non-custodial, browser-based wallet that was reported to affect nearly 8000 users on Solana as well as other ecosystems -- with reported range of between $4.5-8M stolen. It occurred a week ago and Slope just posted their latest update today confirming some of the details in this episode (which was recorded a few days earlier).</li></ul><p>As a reminder: None of the following is investment, business, tax, or legal advice; please see a16z.com/disclosures for more important information, including a link to a list of our investments. </p>

<p>with @enigmida @skominers @smc90</p><p>A special bonus holiday episode (during our brief summer vacation) based on a hallway-style conversation we did linking two seemingly unrelated things: puzzle design, and crypto. <br /><br />What's the connection? Our experts  riff on all things puzzle design, from types of puzzles and mediums to mindsets -- as well as the parallels between the general principles of incentive design, engagement, accessibility, and more to NFTs, escape rooms, games, and other experience design -- drawing on their deep experience and passion from both inside puzzle communities and from work they've done for different crypto projects. </p><p>Hosted by Sonal Chokshi, our guests in this episode are: Scott Kominers (a16z crypto research partner and professor at Harvard Business School), who also wrote Bloomberg’s puzzle column for a couple years; and Matthew Stein (former software engineer at Google and now full-time puzzle designer), who specializes in narrative puzzle hunts, as well as in designing alternate reality games for NFT communities, movies, musicians, companies, individuals, and others. Stein also designs puzzles for Art of Play's art journal; and is a reviewer for Room Escape Artist, the largest escape room website in North America, where he also writes about various topics in immersive gaming.<br /> </p><p><i>As a reminder, none of this is investment, legal, business, or tax advice; please see </i><a href="https://a16z.com/disclosures/" target="_blank"><i>a16z.com/disclosures</i></a><i> for more important information, including a link to a list of our investments. </i></p>

<p>with @RMcElhenney @cdixon @smc90</p><p>This first live taping of 'web3 with a16z' took place an event hosted by a16z crypto & Adim during NFT NYC June 20, 2022 -- with special guest Rob McElhenney* in conversation with Chris Dixon and Sonal Chokshi. Given the theme of "decentralized media"/ "decentralized content creation", the conversation covers decentralized creativity and collaboration; community, creator access; IP and evolution of the internet; and where NFTs and web3 specifically comes in... do we really need web3 for this? <br /><br />We also touch on topics such as the metaverse, storytelling across mediums, managing writer’s rooms, favorite TV shows, nostalgia, and much more.<br /><br /><i>*Rob McElhenney is the creative force behind </i>It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia<i>, the critically-acclaimed FXX comedy series in which he co-stars and serves as executive producer and writer; the fifteenth season premiered in December 2021, breaking the record as the longest-running live-action television sitcom in history.  He  is also the creator, executive producer, and star of </i>Mythic Quest<i>, the acclaimed comedy series that debuted on Apple TV+ (co-created by Megan Ganz and Charlie Day, and a co-production of Ubisoft and Lionsgate Television); it was recognized as one of the best new series of 2020. McElhenney is the co-founder and co-chairperson of </i><a href="https://adimverse.com/" target="_blank"><i>Adim</i></a><i>, which brings web3 technology to creative development to build a new model and value network for creators and collaborators to have a stake in the success and evolution of what they create -- initially through a scaled network of writer's rooms and through a platform for a broad character ecosystem. </i></p><p><i>**As a reminder, none of this is investment, legal, business, or tax advice; please see </i><a href="https://a16z.com/disclosures/" target="_blank"><i>a16z.com/disclosures</i></a><i> for more important information, including a link to a list of our investments. </i></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>with @skominers @tim_roughgarden @smc90</p><p>In this episode, we go into all things auctions – which, broadly defined, are simply ways of selling and allocating scarce things – and which applies in web3 contexts to everything from NFT mints, to blockchains themselves. (Which we also go into in this episode, including an overview of the technical challenges specific to mechanism design in a permissionless context. We also briefly cover EIP 1559). </p><p>We provide a quick overview of auction types, and incentive design, and how it works in both theory and practice -- including the nuances of market-clearing prices, gas wars, and more… sharing tradeoffs, choices, and principles for builders designing these systems throughout. <br /><br />Our expert guests in conversation with host Sonal Chokshi are <strong>Scott Kominers</strong>, a16z crypto research partner and professor at Harvard Business School who specializes in market, marketplace, and incentive design; and <strong>Tim Roughgarden</strong>, head of research at a16zcrypto and professor at Columbia, who led the development of the field of algorithmic game theory -- which brings together computer science and economics to solve real-world computing problems. </p><p> </p><p><i>This conversation includes a brief mention of lotteries, which are sometimes used in conjunction with auctions, and which we kept for educational purposes only. Note there are some questions about the legality of such mechanisms like “sweepstakes” that narrow participants by requiring them to do something to enter -- so builders should NOT use these without consulting a lawyer.
